    //work questions and answers
    <string name="workQ1">What do you do?</string>
    <string name="workA1">For the past few months, I\’ve been working for The Guardian as a news editor. This is my first job ever, and I\’m working hard to contribute to the success of this prestigious newspaper.</string>
    <string name="workQ2">What are your responsibilities?</string>
    <string name="workA2">As a part-time editor, I am responsible for editing news related to current affairs as well as collecting information for the newspaper edition.</string>
    <string name="workQ3">Why did you choose to do that type of work (or, that job)?</string>
    <string name="workA3">I guess it\’s mainly because of job flexibility and my passion for journalism. To be more specific, this job is unlike the nine-to-five work schedule, enabling me to find a better balance between work and life. Besides, this job gives me opportunities to pursue my dream to become a journalist.</string>
    <string name="workQ4">Is there some other kind of work you would rather do?</string>
    <string name="workA4">At present, I don\’t think I\’m able to dedicate myself to any other job. It\’s the experiences and opportunities I can gain that matters to me.</string>
    <string name="workQ5">Describe the company or organization you work for.</string>
    <string name="workA5">The Guardian is a national British daily newspaper which offers free access both to current news and an archive of three million stories. In April 2011, MediaWeek reported that The Guardian was the fifth most popular newspaper site in the world. I believe that the Guardian is the inspirational workplace for all people who dream of becoming a journalist.</string>
    <string name="workQ6">Do you enjoy your work?</string>
    <string name="workA6">I do, most of the time. Contributing to the news production for a world-class newspaper gives me a sense of satisfaction and pride. </string>
    <string name="workQ7">What do you like (or dislike) about your job?</string>
    <string name="workA7">Well, the perk of being a news editor is that you\’ll surround yourself with exciting news daily. What I don\’t like about this job is that I have to do a thousand edits to get to the final one that meets the requirement of my boss. Sometimes I feel a bit overloaded with tons of tasks.</string>
    <string name="workQ8">Do you miss being a student?</string>
    <string name="workA8">I missed student life once I got involved in the workplace. I think when I was a student, I had someone to guide me, whereas at work you must guide yourself. The academic environment was a comfort zone, and I struggled to fit in the working environment.</string>

    //study questions and answers
    <string name="studyQ1">Do you work or study?</string>
    <string name="studyA1">I am currently studying. I am in the 11th semester and my major is economics.</string>
    <string name="studyQ2">Where do you study?</string>
    <string name="studyA2">I study in the (…university name…). It is one of the best private universities in our country. My major is Economics.</string>
    <string name="studyQ3">What is the name of your college (or university)?</string>
    <string name="studyA3">The name of my university is (…say the full name of your university…). It is more popularly known as (…name that people call it in short…).</string>
    <string name="studyQ4">What subject are you studying?</string>
    <string name="studyA4">My major is Economics. I completed my school majoring commerce and studying in Economics was a long dream for me.</string>
    <string name="studyQ5">Which part of the course do you enjoy most?</string>
    <string name="studyA5">I enjoy learning new things in every semester. The project works in each semester is the part I enjoy most. These projects enable me to work in a group and hands on the theories I learn throughout the semester.</string>
    <string name="studyQ6">Why did you choose to study that?</string>
    <string name="studyA6">Honestly, I did not particularly select this subject. I attended the university admission test in commerce faculty and based on my performance on the exam and interview with the faculty members, I was offered this subject from their end. I wanted to study in commerce faculty and now I feel very lucky that I was offered this major.</string>
    <string name="studyQ7">Is it a difficult subject to study?</string>
    <string name="studyA7">In a general sense, this subject requires extensive study, research, group works and other academic activities. Things are new and challenging in many cases but I think with passion and dedication it can be conquered. To me, it is a difficult yet very enjoyable subject.</string>
    <string name="studyQ8">What is your favourite subject?</string>
    <string name="studyA8">Economics without any doubt is my favourite subject. I am very fascinated to discover the connection of this subject in our everyday life and the global economic structure has made it more complex yet more intriguing. I love to explore different theories and researches done on this subjects and how economics is all around us.</string>
    <string name="studyQ9">What kind of school did you go to?</string>
    <string name="studyA9">In my early childhood, I studied in a local English medium school and then was shifted to a government school by my parents when I was in grade 7. I was in a cantonment college and I have finished my twelve class degree from there. Now I am studying at a large university which is one of the best public universities in my country.</string>
    <string name="studyQ10">What was your favourite subject at school?</string>
    <string name="studyA10">Organisational behaviour, microeconomics were my two most favourite subjects so far. These two subjects have built my base and love for the whole course and I still find it fascinating.</string>
    <string name="studyQ11">What is the best thing about your university/school?</string>
    <string name="studyA11">I love my university life. The classes, friends, teachers, university life, my freedom to do so many things and my participation in some charity works organised by the university are equally important to me. If I have to select one best thing about my university, I would choose my exposure to a diverse culture and academic life that has motivated and inspired me to do even better than I initially thought. I was exposed to a life and era that was unimaginable to me and that is the best part of my university life so far.</string>
    <string name="studyQ12">What part of university life do you like best?</string>
    <string name="studyA12">Well, I think my previous answer already covers this answer. However, I would say I enjoy most of my university life and my exposure to a whole new culture that I never imagined is the best part of my university life. My university life offers me a vision for my future and potential jobs sectors and I think this is the best part.</string>
    <string name="studyQ13">What is the educational system like in your country?</string>
    <string name="studyA13">I am glad that you asked this question. In our country, the primary education is mandatory for all and it is funded by the government unless someone wants to send his kids to a private English medium school. The secondary and tertiary education systems are also managed and run by the government and private organisations. The government controlled educational institutes are less costly and the curriculums are presented and monitored by the education board. On the other hand, the private educational institutes are bound to include some of the national curriculums and they mostly follow their own syllabus. In all universities and in many colleges, higher education is offered in English. The technical and vocational colleges and universities are also popular in our country and they mostly offer certification and degree in selected technical and practical skill related fields. The private universities are approved by the Government controlled bodies and they have to follow their rules very strictly. I am happy to see many changes brought to our educational system in the last few years and innovation and quality modern education is a vision our country has already started implementing.</string>
    <string name="studyQ14">What are your future study plans?</string>
    <string name="studyA14">It will take me 7 months more or so to finish my graduation and then I will try to get admitted to a foreign university which has a reputation for better education. There I will complete my Master\’s degree and would get involved in a job. Besides doing the job I have plans to get enrolled in a professional MBS course to further my education. If time allows, I also wish to do some research based courses related to my academic background and interest.</string>
    <string name="studyQ15">What kind of job would you prefer after graduation?</string>
    <string name="studyA15">I would prefer to work in a multinational company which will offer me a position related to my academic background and have a positive working environment to learn and explore new things. I would not worry too much about my designation and salary initially but the company must have sufficient scope for career enhancement.</string>
    <string name="studyQ16">What is your career plan after you graduate?</string>
    <string name="studyA16">For the first few years, I will work in a multinational company. Then maybe in 10 years, I will plan to start my own business. I would like to be an entrepreneur rather than working in a company for the rest of my life. I know being an entrepreneur is not that easy and it requires a lot of dedication and commitment. However, I would work to fulfil this plan after I finish my graduation.</string>
    <string name="studyQ17">Why are you taking the IELTS test?  </string>
    <string name="studyA17">I am mainly taking the test to achieve a band score I require to apply in most of the reputed universities in Australia or Canada. As I have my plans to complete my Master\’s degree in a reputed foreign university, the IELTS score is a pre-requisite to prove my ability to handle the language – English, and I need the score to even apply to those universities.</string>

    //hometown questions and answers
    <string name="hometownQ1">What\’s (the name of) your hometown and where is it?</string>
    <string name="hometownA1">Victoria is my hometown. It is a province located in the west of my country.</string>
    <string name="hometownQ2">Is that a big city or a small place?</string>
    <string name="hometownA2">It is a small province with slightly more than 1 million people.</string>
    <string name="hometownQ3">Please describe your hometown a little?</string>
    <string name="hometownA3">It has a breathtaking view of picturesque landscapes with rolling mountains and greenish lakes. However, due to the increasing economy, a number of businesses, especially in sugarcane, are invested in my hometown making it very promising.</string>
    <string name="hometownQ4">How long have you been living there?</string>
    <string name="hometownA4">I had lived there for around 15 years before my family left for Santa City. It\’s been more than ten years since I left my hometown.</string>
    <string name="hometownQ5">Do you like your hometown? If yes, what do you like (most) about your hometown?</string>
    <string name="hometownA5">Yes, I do like my hometown! I like the hospitality of people in my hometown. Also, everyone was willing to give others a hand when they needed help.</string>
    <string name="hometownQ6">Is there anything you dislike about it?</string>
    <string name="hometownA6">Personally, it\’s a bit boring for me because as a small town, there isn\’t a shopping mall or any other means of entertainment. The streets don\’t get very crowded as well. However, I believe that it is improving day by day and turning into a potential hotspot due to the increasing number of annual visitors.</string>
    <string name="hometownQ7">Do you often visit your hometown?</string>
    <string name="hometownA7">I do visit occasionally when there are some celebrations. I also go on a long drive after some hectic weekends.</string>
    <string name="hometownQ8">Do you think you will continue living there for a long time?</string>
    <string name="hometownA8">To be honest, I hope I could go there to visit my relatives and friends, but settling down is not part of my plan. I am now getting familiar with city life as there are more job opportunities here.</string>
    <string name="hometownQ9">Has your hometown changed much since you were a child?</string>
    <string name="hometownA9">Actually yes. It has changed enormously. Around 20 years ago you would barely find tall buildings in my area, but now you\’d easily be able to catch sight of skyscrapers and tower blocks there.</string>
    <string name="hometownQ10">Are there any changes you would like to make in your hometown?</string>
    <string name="hometownA10">I would like to ameliorate the infrastructure so that I can avoid being stuck in a traffic jam during peak hours.</string>

    //home answers and questions
    <string name="homeQ1">What kind of housing/accommodation do you live in?</string>
    <string name="homeA1">For the past 21 years, I have lived in a house with my family. And I think if I can move out and start making a living on my own, I would try my best to have an independent place where I can plan and design a house layout to suit myself since sharing a room or a flat with strangers sounds so troublesome to me.</string>
    <string name="homeQ2">What do you usually do in your house/flat/room?</string>
    <string name="homeA2">Well, definitely I\’ll spend some time there. I study, I chill out by reading, drawing and dancing all by myself. Sometimes I also invite one or two friends to spend time with. We\’ll watch some movies together and tell each other endless stories.</string>
    <string name="homeQ3">Who do you live with?</string>
    <string name="homeA3">I live with my family. There are 5 of us and we all have our own room, which is way more comfortable as the older we grow, the more privacy we need for ourselves. I think our house is big enough for us yet still a warm and cosy place that I call home.</string>
    <string name="homeQ4">How long have you lived there?</string>
    <string name="homeA4">Although during my childhood my family had to move a lot, I\’ve lived in the most recent house for almost ten years. Comparing to the old houses, I think this house has been the best so far.</string>
    <string name="homeQ5">Do you plan to live there for a long time?</string>
    <string name="homeA5">The answer would be yes. My parents have been living there for a long time and moving in and out is too time-consuming and exhausting. Cleaning and arranging everything all over again would be like torture to them. For me, on the other hand, as I\’m thinking of moving out to start my adult life, hopefully soon I\’ll be able to afford to live in a flat or an apartment.</string>
    <string name="homeQ6">What\’s the difference between where you are living now and where you have lived in the past?</string>
    <string name="homeA6">As I\’ve already mentioned my family moved several times when I was younger. And the most current house where we’ve been living for about ten years is the best house so far. All of us have separate rooms for our need for privacy yet a big dining room where we can spend the whole evenings together watching TV or having dinner.</string>
    <string name="homeQ7">Can you describe the place where you live?/ Please describe the room you live in</string>
    <string name="homeA7">Briefly, my humble house locates in a small and quiet street, so coming home to me is like all the craziness happened outside is left behind. Just beside my house stands a big old tree. I have my own room with walls painted violet, which is kind of a peaceful colour. The air outside is fresh. I usually open the window to enjoy the wind and sunshine, which will help cool my room without an air conditioner. Since I spend most of my time staying at home, my room means the whole world to me. It\’s like a friend who is always there to share ups and downs with me. So yeah, I would always miss my house, my room whenever I\’m away.</string>
    <string name="homeQ8">Which part of your home do you like the most?</string>
    <string name="homeA8">It\’s the dining room where my family spends our time together.  Not only lunch or dinner but all our family reunions take place in the dining room where we can enjoy a harmonious atmosphere. We always try to keep the family dinner as something we cannot go a day without, since for us it\’s the family bonding that lies behind.</string>

    //Art
    <string name="artQ1"> Do you like art?</string>
    <string name="artA1">I have a lifelong passion for art since I was a child. Beside the official art class in school, I also joined a drawing class in The Children\’ House and my teachers were very pleased with my drawings. I also participated in some drawing competitions back then. Until now I still draw in my free time, although not as often as I used to do.</string>
    <string name="artQ2">Do you think art classes are necessary? (Why?)/ How do you think art classes affect children\’s development?</string>
    <string name="artA2">Yes, definitely. Learning arts, especially at a young age, can help stimulate children\’s cognitive development and encourage them to think outside the box. Because they\’re still little, their ideas are very fresh and lovely, which is worth appreciating.</string>
    <string name="artQ3">Are you good at art?</string>
    <string name="artA3">Art is a really vast subject, I believe and if it is about drawing things here and there, I would say I am pretty fine at it. But, I am surely not one of those who can make some masterpieces. I think I am good at it, all thanks to the art classes that I attended during my teen years. They were a great help during my growing years and taught me lot of creativity. Now, I can easily draw simple day to day things like pen or a face.</string>
    <string name="artQ4">What kind of paintings do people like?</string>
    <string name="artA4">In my opinion, people love hanging landscape paintings at home. Bringing in the beauty of Mother Nature somehow ease people\’s mind after a long day at work. Another style of drawing that most people also like is portrait. It could be portraits of someone important to them or even their lovely pets.</string>
    <string name="artQ5">What benefits can you get from painting as a hobby?</string>
    <string name="artA5">I think the mediation efficiency worth mentioning first. Colours in some ways reflect our thoughts and emotions very well and somehow stimulate our body to defend against our negativity inside. For me, in particular, I think what\’s so interesting about painting is that you have no idea how harmonized colours can become until you actually try.</string>
    <string name="artQ6">How often do you visit art galleries?</string>
    <string name="artA6">To tell you the truth, I have never visited art galleries before. Unless I have a guide to acknowledge me, art galleries would be quite boring for me.</string>
    <string name="artQ7">What kinds of things do you like to draw?</string>
    <string name="artA7">My main inspiration is Japanese manga. The drawing topic is extremely varied, however only manga seems to show great potency for my level. I have a big collection at home and as I sometimes go through it again, I can see how much I\’ve improved.</string>
    <string name="artQ8">Is it easy to learn how to draw?</string>
    <string name="artA8">I think I must say it\’s even challenging for a lot of people. I absolutely failed when it comes to drawing still life paintings like fruit and flowers. I think for those who succeed in drawing or arts in general, they first must have God-gifted talent, then comes to the long-term commitment to arts that requires extreme practice and high patience.</string>

    //Birthday
    <string name="birthdayQ1">How do children celebrate birthdays in your country?</string>
    <string name="birthdayA1">Children in my country celebrate their birthdays by inviting friends and relatives to their homes. They love to cut the cake and play indoor games at birthday parties.</string>
    <string name="birthdayQ2">How did you celebrate your last birthday?</string>
    <string name="birthdayA2">For my last birthday, I went on a two days trip to Zamin mountains with my family members. We went sightseeing and enjoyed a lot during that trip. My parents even kept a surprise party planned for me there. </string>
    <string name="birthdayQ3">What kinds of birthday gifts do you like to receive?</string>
    <string name="birthdayA3">On my birthdays, I like to receive handmade gifts such as cards, photo albums, etc. Also, I really love to receive storybooks as gifts.</string>
    <string name="birthdayQ4">Is there a difference between the way you celebrate your birthday in the past and in the present?</string>
    <string name="birthdayA4">Yes, in the past I used to invite my friends at home for a birthday party and my mother would cook food for us. But for the last two or three years, I like to go to a restaurant or cafe for parties with my friends.</string>
    <string name="birthdayQ5">How do you usually celebrate your birthday?</string>
    <string name="birthdayA5">I normally throw a party and invite all of my friends. Birthdays are a big thing in my family and in my culture, so we go all out when we celebrate them.</string>
    <string name="birthdayQ6">Are there any birthdays that are special in your culture?</string>
    <string name="birthdayA6">Yes, there a a few birthdays that are unique. These are the ones that occur when you are 13, 16,18,21 and 30. They usually have some connection to the law in the country, for example when you are 16 you are legally considered an adult and when you are 18 you can legally purchase alcohol or drive a car. </string>
    <string name="birthdayQ7">Can you remember a birthday you had as a child?</string>
    <string name="birthdayA7">Yes, the most memorable birthday I have ever had was when my mum and dad rented out a huge bouncing castle in secret and invited all my friends and family without telling me. I came home from school to find everyone waiting for me in my back garden. It was such a surprise!</string>

    //Childhood
    <string name="childhoodQ1">Did you enjoy your childhood?</string>
    <string name="childhoodA1">Yes, very much. My childhood was filled with lots of laughter, a great family of 3 generations, friends that were indispensable. My childhood was fun as I was free of worries because I had my basic needs met, and in instances where I was met with a challenge, there were family members ready to help and to encourage me to overcome it. In all, I really enjoyed being a child and often recalled the memories with a happy smile.</string>
    <string name="childhoodQ2">What is your first memory of your childhood?</string>
    <string name="childhoodA2">On days when my grandmother held the hands of my twin and me as we walked to school is by far my freshest and deepest memory of childhood. On days when it rained, she would help us jump the puddles; on days when it was sunny, she was sure to have an umbrella. Walking hand-in-hand with smiles on our faces, she would tell us interesting stories of children who studied well in school and became great individuals. I must say the experience left an indelible mark.</string>
    <string name="childhoodQ3">Did you have a lot of friends when you were a child?</string>
    <string name="childhoodA3">At school, I had lots of friends, perhaps partly because I am a twin and most people love twins and because I was an outgoing child. Even my teachers were my friends, and one still is as I\’ve kept in touch with her throughout the years. At home, my friends were numerous. They won\’t come to visit on weekends and spend lots of time with me playing house.</string>
    <string name="childhoodQ4">What did you enjoy doing as a child?</string>
    <string name="childhoodA4">playing house was my most loved pastime. Putting jigsaw puzzles together was another thing I enjoyed as it was challenging and could involve my friends and me. At times when I was with friends, I loved to read the books of my elder siblings. Sometimes I understood a little of what was written in the books; other times, I didn\’t, but I just loved them though I usually got reprimanded for dirtying them.</string>
    <string name="childhoodQ5">Do you think it is better for children to grow up in the city or in the countryside?</string>
    <string name="childhoodA5">there are positives and negatives to growing up in the city and to growing up in the countryside. Personally, I think it\’s better for children to grow up in the countryside where there is little to no pollution of the environment. In the countryside, there is access to fresh and healthy farm produce and as well as various fruits, even wild ones which contain natural vitamins and minerals to aid in the growth. In the countryside, where there are close-knit families, they learn about the value of family relationships and how everyone is interdependent.</string>
    <string name="childhoodQ6">What was the best thing about your childhood?</string>
    <string name="childhoodA6">The best thing about my childhood has to be the fact that I made little friends. It was early in life that I had learnt that it is great to have friends but one can enjoy by oneself as well and that it is better if you have friends who will stick all through your life. I have been more independent because no one could ever tell me that I could not do it.</string>
    <string name="childhoodQ7">What do you miss most about being a child?</string>
    <string name="childhoodA7">The best part about being a child is that no one cares how you look, because they look at your habits, your eyes, what you speak. It gives so much more freedom, when there is no sophistication associated with you, nothing to pretend, no one to impress and living life on your terms, in the present with no care about future.</string>
    <string name="childhoodQ8">Do you think that children these days have a better or worse childhood than your generation? Why?</string>
    <string name="childhoodA8">I think definitely, children have a better childhood than our generation. Parents are now more aware and work on their children, developing the skills of their children.You can now see children working on things like cricket, music, dance activities. However, when it comes to general development, I think our generation was better. We were more aware of our families, we had stories to share, we had met our grandparents more often, heard stories from them and enjoyed life more better.</string>
    <string name="childhoodQ9">What do you think is most important for a happy childhood?</string>
    <string name="childhoodA9">The most important thing for a happy childhood is a happy home. It is very important for a child to grow as a happy individual to have a home where his/her parents love each other. Where, there is a balance in life.</string>
    <string name="childhoodQ10">What about your childhood do you wish you could change?</string>
    <string name="childhoodA10">If ever I could change one thing about my childhood, it would be my relation with my brother. For some reasons, I think we as children, never talked to each other much and it was later in life that I came to know that we both were two lonely souls and could have stuck together and enjoyed life as we grew up.</string>
    <string name="childhoodQ11">Where did you grow up? How did that affect your childhood?</string>
    <string name="childhoodA11">I have grown up in different places because of my father\’s transfer. Travelling to different places as I grew up, taught me that we all are the same, fundamentally. As humans, we have the same problems and the same goals. It is just that some fight for them till the end, while others tend to lose hope and it is that one determination, love that changes and shapes our lives.</string>
    <string name="childhoodQ12">What were some of your favorite activities when you were a child?</string>
    <string name="childhoodA12">I love cycling when I was a child. Cycling gave me the sense that I was free, that there was nothing that could stop me and I could just live the life as I want to and it was this feeling that made me love cycling even more. I remember, cycling during holidays and then evenings, even in the morning. I just loved it.</string>
    <string name="childhoodQ13">Who, besides your parents, had the biggest impact on your childhood?</string>
    <string name="childhoodA13">I think as a child, my relatives had a very great impact on me. It was their opinions that have shaped to an extent the things that I believe in and the things that I do. It was when I started questioning their opinion, that I realized how fragile their opinion was, changing every minutes. It was through them that I learnt that we should just keep doing what we love.</string>
    <string name="childhoodQ14">What do you want to provide your children that you didn\’t have when you were growing up?</string>
    <string name="childhoodA14">Feeling of the fact that I am their friend. Yes, this is one thing that I want my children to know, that no matter what, I am their friend and whatever is happening in their lives, they can share it with me. I want to know my issues and share with me theirs. I wish to have conversations like we have with our friends.</string>
    <string name="childhoodQ15">Who were you really jealous of when you were a child? Why were you jealous?</string>
    <string name="childhoodA15">As a child, I was jealous of those pretty girls in my class. I mean I used to wonder how could come school on time, wearing clean clothes and then score high in exams as well. I used to be the one who was always clumsy, figuring out things from here and there.</string>

    //Clothes
    <string name="clothesQ1">What colour clothes do you like to wear?</string>
    <string name="clothesA1">Well, I like to wear attires of all the colours, but mostly I prefer bright colours because light colours don\’t suit my personality and I don\’t feel comfortable whenever I wear light colour clothes.</string>
    <string name="clothesQ2">Do people in your country like to wear bright colours?</string>
    <string name="clothesA2">It is very hard to define the preference of all people for what colour they like. But yes I think that people like to wear bright colours in my country especially on special occasions like weddings because I always see everyone in bright colours at functions and marriages.</string>
    <string name="clothesQ3">What are the differences between men\’s and women\’s preferences in colour?</string>
    <string name="clothesA3">According to my perspective, there is no gender preference as I see both boys and girls wearing almost all colours. However, one colour that is most preferred by girls is pink, and I think black is more common among boys.</string>
    <string name="clothesQ4">What kind of clothes do you like to wear?</string>
    <string name="clothesA4">Well, I like to wear Punjabi suits because it defines my culture and tradition. Moreover, I feel comfortable while wearing my own traditional clothes.</string>
    <string name="clothesQ5">What kind of clothes do you never wear?</string>
    <string name="clothesA5">Honestly speaking, I never wear short clothes because they are not allowed in my culture and my family. Moreover, it looks awkward if someone wears shorts in my region.</string>
    <string name="clothesQ6">Do you wear the same style of clothes on the weekend and on the weekdays?</string>
    <string name="clothesA6">No, definitely not as I am a student and I have to wear a uniform on weekdays but on weekends I just wear t-shirts with trousers while staying at home that is more comfortable for me.</string>
    <string name="clothesQ7">Do you wear the same clothes at school/work?</string>
    <string name="clothesA7">At school, I usually wear school uniforms, and it is very boring to wear the same uniform all day.</string>
    <string name="clothesQ8">Did you have any special clothes when you were a child?</string>
    <string name="clothesA8">Yes, of course, I remember that there was an annual function in my school when I was in 2nd grade, and I took part in that. So, my mother made beautiful clothes for me to wear on that occasion which was very special for me because it was so attractive.</string>

    //Daily Routine
    <string name="daily_routineQ1">When do you wake up?</string>
    <string name="daily_routineA1">Well, I\’m a morning riser, and I wake up at about 5 o’clock. Getting up early not only makes me feel refreshed and productive, but also prevents my skin from having wrinkles.</string>
    <string name="daily_routineQ2">What is your daily routine?</string>
    <string name="daily_routineA2">Well, in the morning, I get up early to have a light breakfast and hit the gym at about 8 a.m. After one hour of workout, I leave the gym club and go to the supermarket to buy food to prepare lunch and dinner. In the afternoon and evening, I go to my workplace and start working from 14.00.pm until 21.00.p.m.</string>
    <string name="daily_routineQ3">What part of the day do you like most?</string>
    <string name="daily_routineA3">I enjoy it late at night when I come home from work, and everything is filled with dim grey light. To me, it\’s a great time to kick back on the bed to have a chit-chat with my roommates, surf the Internet, listen to music, or watch a favorite movie.</string>
    <string name="daily_routineQ4">Do you think it is important to have a daily routine?</string>
    <string name="daily_routineA4">Yes, it is. A proper daily routine will help you arrange your activities most sensibly. Without a daily routine, people usually do things spontaneously, which could waste their time and reduce their work efficiency. I think those who are disorganized can gain more benefits from creating a daily routine.</string>
    <string name="daily_routineQ5">What\’s the difference in routine between you and your teenage times?</string>
    <string name="daily_routineA5">Well, I can say that there\’s a vast difference between my life then and my present life. You know, when I was a teenager, besides focusing on study, I had much free time to pursue my interests like watching films or listening to music. In contrast, my routine and time management have become stricter now. Since I graduated from university and began working as an English teacher, I\’m so occupied with my work that I have little leisure time.</string>
    <string name="daily_routineQ6">What is the busiest part of the day for you?</string>
    <string name="daily_routineA6">Afternoons are the busiest time of the day for me. I work for a UK company and my day starts at 2:00 PM. So by 3:00 PM I will be bombarded with client calls and emails and will have no time to breathe.</string>
    <string name="daily_routineQ7">Do you usually have the same routine every day? (or) Do you usually do the same things at the same time each day?</string>
    <string name="daily_routineA7">Mostly yes. I\’m an early bird though I go late to bed. On weekdays, my work starts at 2:00 PM and I wind up by 11:00 PM. On weekends, I go shopping and sleep a little early. I follow this schedule every week and there aren\’t any major changes unless we have celebrations.</string>
    <string name="daily_routineQ8">Have you ever changed your routine?</string>
    <string name="daily_routineA8">Yes, it changed about a month ago. I had a very tight schedule and was struggling to manage my targets. So I had to work late until 2:00 AM.</string>
    <string name="daily_routineQ9">What would you like to change in your daily routine?</string>
    <string name="daily_routineA9">My work starts at 2:00 PM. So I laze around until then. I want to use that time productively. Some of my friends go to the gym and I would like to start an exercise regime as well.</string>
    <string name="daily_routineQ10">Do you like to plan what you will do each day?</string>
    <string name="daily_routineA10">Yes, I would like to. Planning keeps the day in your control. The more organized you are, the better your life becomes. I\’m pretty orderly at work and I want to be the same way in my other activities as well.</string>
    <string name="daily_routineQ11">What do you usually do at this time of day?</string>
    <string name="daily_routineA11">It is 10:30 AM now. You can find me watching television or reading a magazine. Sometimes I go out and talk to my friends.</string>
    <string name="daily_routineQ12">How do you organize your study time?</string>
    <string name="daily_routineA12">I’m pursuing a course in Management along with my work. I usually study on the weekends because I want an entire day to myself. I don\’t study on weekdays as it becomes stressful.</string>

    //Food
    <string name="foodQ1">What kind of food do you like to eat? </string>
    <string name="foodA1">I mostly like homemade foods. They are hygienic, made from organic sources and have no chemicals or adhesive. However, my preference in homemade foods does not discourage me to dine outside. I prefer having dinner in a Chinese or Italian restaurant as I love their menu. I am also fond of Pizza and Sandwich.</string>
    <string name="foodQ2">What kind of new food would you like to try? Why?</string>
    <string name="foodA2">I have never tried Thai foods and I would love to taste it. One of my cousins is very fond of Thai foods and he had convinced me that I should give it a try. I think I would like it. I have a plan to take my family to a renowned restaurant in our city to taste the Thai foods together. Apart from that, I would love to try Japanese Sushi. I have heard so much about it but have never tasted it.</string>
    <string name="foodQ3">Do you like cooking? Why/ Why not?</string>
    <string name="foodA3">I love cooking. This is sometimes very relaxing and gives a good feeling. I do not need to cook very often but when I do, I feel like I kind of enjoy it. Maybe if I had to cook every day, my opinion could have been different! My mom mostly cooks in our house and whenever I declare that I would cook either for lunch or dinner, my brothers and sisters become excited and worried at the same time. They love the way I try to cook different menu each time and they often find my cooking tasty but they also remember some of the incidents when my foods tasted horrible. But if you ask me whether I enjoy cooking, I would say yes, and I like doing experiments no matter what others think about it.</string>
    <string name="foodQ4">What was the last meal you cooked?</string>
    <string name="foodA4">That must be more than 3 months since I cooked last time. It was fried rice with eggs, prawn and vegetables. I also cooked mutton with curry and as a desert, I made apple pie. Fortunately, this time, my siblings were pleased with my cooking!!!</string>
    <string name="foodQ5">Do you prefer home-cooked food or food from restaurants? Why?</string>
    <string name="foodA5">As I said my preference is home-cooked foods over outside foods. My father does not like the idea of having outside meals that often. Apart from that, my mother is an excellent cook and we enjoy her menu a lot. Outside foods are quite expensive and not fully hygienic. This is why all of my family members prefer home-made foods.</string>
    <string name="foodQ6">What are some kinds of food you never eat? Why?</string>
    <string name="foodA6">Stuffed peppers, pan-fried Scottish scallops served with tomato relish, salmon mollee, Japanese Sushi, popadums, Sour cream and Chive fries and Shrimp cocktails are some of the food items I have never eaten. Most of these items are not common in our city and I have heard about those menus from my friends. Since they are not available in our city and I do not have an extensive travelling experience, I did not get the chance to take them.</string>
    <string name="foodQ7">What are some reasons that people eat at a restaurant?</string>
    <string name="foodA7">Eating at a restaurant offers people to enjoy the foods as well as the views and surrounding. They do not need to cook and foods are usually delicious. People are treated well in a restaurant and people love that a lot. We can invite as many people as we want in a restaurant and we do not need to clean anything unlike eating at home. There are a variety of menus to choose from and people can enjoy exotic foods at a restaurant that are not usually cooked at home. We can meet friends and other relatives at a restaurant and enjoy our conversation without interruption. I think those are the main reasons we like to eat out in a restaurant even though we have to pay a large amount of money for the foods we eat.</string>
    <string name="foodQ8">Describe a popular food in your country? Why do people like this food?</string>
    <string name="foodA8">Pizza is most probably one of the most popular food items in my county. This was not on the list of popular food items probably 10 years back, but the popularity of pizza, especially, among young people is unbelievable nowadays. The popularity is probably because of its taste and easy availability. Every corner of a street has a fast food shop in my town and they sell pizza. Craze among young generation about the fast food items, especially pizza, is another reason it is so popular in my country.</string>
    <string name="foodQ9">What kinds of food do you particularly like?</string>
    <string name="foodA9">I\’d have to say Asian cuisine is my favorite. I am a huge fan of the bold flavors and spices used in Korean and Vietnamese dishes. Something I often daydream about eating is X, which is a tip-smacking noodle soup dish served with a crab broth. It\’s every bit as delicious as it sounds.</string>
    <string name="foodQ10">Is there any food you don\’t like?</string>
    <string name="foodA10">It\’s true that there are a few things that kind of put me off. For example, I cannot stand Y, which is essentially a shrimp paste. A lot of people like it, though, but I think it smells awful. Definitely not my cup of tea.</string>
    <string name="foodQ11">What kinds of food are most popular in your country?</string>
    <string name="foodA11">I think street food is a staple around here. You can find bustling food stalls all around our nation, and they are my go-tos for a cheap and cheerful meal. I mean gourmet restaurants are nice and all, but street food is what our country is all about.</string>
    <string name="foodQ12">Do you like cooking? (Why?/ Why not?)</string>
    <string name="foodA12">Actually, I\’d like to think that cooking is my forte. I developed a passion for culinary arts when I first watched the cooking show Masterchef. Since then, I have learnt a lot of recipes and I can easily whip up a good dinner.</string>

    //hobbies
    <string name="hobbyQ1">Do you have any hobbies?</string>
    <string name="hobbyA1">Well, everyone has their own leisure pursuits, and mine is reading. The book I\’m reading at the moment is The Godfather by renowned author Mario Puzo. It\’s a classic, really, and I\’d recommend it.</string>
    <string name="hobbyQ2">Is it important to have a hobby?</string>
    <string name="hobbyA2">Definitely! I mean nowadays life is getting more and more hectic, so people are always under an enormous amount of stress. That\’s why it\’s helpful to get into some recreational activities to be able to unwind and just forget about life for a minute, you know?</string>
    <string name="hobbyQ3">Is it harmful to spend too much time on a hobby?</string>
    <string name="hobbyA3">Yes, I believe spending excessive time on a hobby may have an adverse effect on people. You may end up having not enough time for your priorities like family or work. For example, it\’s easy for me to lose myself in books and neglect the deadlines at work.</string>
    <string name="hobbyQ4">What free-time activities would you like to try in the future?</string>
    <string name="hobbyA4">I would love to have a crack at extreme sports in the future, maybe ski-diving. It looks like a blast and I think I will get a real kick out of free-falling from enormous heights.</string>
    <string name="hobbyQ5">Do you have a hobby?</string>
    <string name="hobbyA5">Yes, I have numerous hobbies such as reading books, playing cricket, adventure sports, Art and craft activities.After that my favourite hobby is reading books as well as with the help of reading books I can enhance my knowledge and vocabulary.</string>

    <string name="hobbyQ7">Do you think hobbies should be shared with other people?</string>
    <string name="hobbyA7">Yeah, we do hobbies to enjoy, for fun purposes, we will feel happy because of it, so by sharing our hobby with another person, I think, it could make them happy as well.</string>
    <string name="hobbyQ8">Did you have a hobby as a child?</string>
    <string name="hobbyA8">Yes, in my childhood I have so many hobbies. During my childhood, my favourite hobby is playing badminton and watching tv shows. Apart from that, I utilize my all-time to play badminton.</string>
    <string name="hobbyQ9">What hobbies are popular in your country?</string>
    <string name="hobbyA9">Well, there are a number of hobbies that are famous in my nation, such as indoor and outdoor games, adventure sports, art and craft activities. Further, in my nation different people like the different types of hobbies. Apart from it, mostly youngsters like to do adventures sports, as well as the girls, like to do animation and indoor games. So that\’s why people like hobbies according to your choice.</string>
    <string name="hobbyQ10">Why do you think people have hobbies?</string>
    <string name="hobbyA10">Well, Hobbies is the best way to utilize their leisure time. Apart from that, hobbies help them to relieve tension and stress After doing the hobbies, people can maintain their body as well as they can share their talent with others. So hobbies play an indispensable role in human life.</string>

    //internet
    <string name="internetQ1">How important is the internet to you?</string>
    <string name="internetA1">Extremely important. I depend on it for work, research, study and entertainment, so without it I\’d be complete lost.</string>
    <string name="internetQ2">How often do you use the internet?</string>
    <string name="internetA2">I use it constantly throughout the day, every day. I check my emails when I get up in the morning, I use it for work all day and then I watch videos, read books or listen to music through it at night.</string>
    <string name="internetQ3">What are your favourite websites?</string>
    <string name="internetA3">For work my two favourite sites are WordPress and Google. WordPress is a blogging tool that allows you to publish blogs easily and maintain a professional looking website. Google of course allows me to find the information I need quickly and accurately. In my spare time, I of course use Facebook like everyone else in the world, but my favourite site is The Guardian because it allows me to keep up to date with everything that\’s happening.</string>
    <string name="internetQ4">Do you use apps?</string>
    <string name="internetA4">I\’m a bit of an app addict. My favourite app at the moment is one called Stitcher. It allows you to listen to podcasts and helps you discover new podcasts. You can download them and then listen to them whenever you have time.</string>
    <string name="internetQ5">Do you think you use the internet too much?</string>
    <string name="internetA5">I think most people do these days. My problem is that there are so many sites and apps that you end up checking them way too often and this wastes lots of time. It can also be a bit anti-social if you are checking your phone all the time when you are with other people.</string>
    <string name="internetQ6">How will the internet develop in the future?</string>
    <string name="internetA6">I think it will be more on mobile phones than computers. Smart phones are becoming more powerful and more affordable all the time, so I think we will see a shift from people using the internet on desktop computers to mobiles and apps rather than traditional websites.</string>
    <string name="internetQ7">Are there any negative things about the internet?</string>
    <string name="internetA7">Being connected all of the time is not a good thing. Before you had to sit down at your computer and log on and that took time, so you didn\’t do it so much. Now all people have to do is look at their phone and this is too much for me. I\’ve been trying to leave my phone at home when I socialise with friends and family to stop myself from focusing too much on the phone rather than them</string>
    <string name="internetQ8">How important is Internet to you?</string>
    <string name="internetA8">The Internet is like a staple food for me; I use this thing almost all the time, for work, study, and a lot of other things.</string>
    <string name="internetQ9">Do you use the Internet more for work or in your free time?</string>
    <string name="internetA9">during my free time, I usually prefer to relax and surf on any social media application unless it is necessary to complete the work within a limited deadline.</string>
    <string name="internetQ10">Do you think you use Internet too much?</string>
    <string name="internetA10">Definitely, I am a person deeply involved in social networking hence requires too much internet than a normal user.</string>
    <string name="internetQ11">How will Internet develop in the future?</string>
    <string name="internetA11">Well, with the increase of Internet users, the Internet in the future will reach all people around the world, although in deserts, mountains, deep forests, or even in the deep of the ocean, people are able to use the Internet without any hesitation in connection.</string>

    //Leisure time
    <string name="leisure_timeQ1">What do you do in your spare time?</string>
    <string name="leisure_timeA1">It varies, I mean, it depends on the amount of free time I have. A few weeks ago, I would normally immerse myself in a light novel during lunch breaks or after dinner, but these days, I’m just too busy with my work that the only thing I crave is some sleep, so all my spare time would be devoted to taking a quick nap.</string>
    <string name="leisure_timeQ2">What do you do to relax?</string>
    <string name="leisure_timeA2">These days, I’ve been suffering from severe stress and depression due to the excessive amount of workload I have, and the only time I can relax is during my 4 – 5 hours of sleep every night. So, it may sound a little bit weird, but the only thing I can do to relax is, sadly, sleep.</string>
    <string name="leisure_timeQ3">How do you usually spend your weekends?</string>
    <string name="leisure_timeA3">I\’m not a party animal, so during weekends, I always refuse all the party invitations from my friends. Instead, I would visit a café on my own and indulge myself with a nice cup of earl grey and some new book I\’ve found on Amazon. That couldn\’t be more perfect for a Sunday afternoon.</string>
    <string name="leisure_timeQ4">What do you usually do after work or classes?</string>
    <string name="leisure_timeA4">I work evening shifts, so on a daily basis, I stop at around 9 p.m. and leave work 15 – 30 minutes later. At that time, most shops have already closed and there’re not many recreational activities left to do if you don’t want to hang around bars, so I often go straight home to take a hot shower and have a late dinner. Once in a while, my boyfriend would take me to the movies after work, but I would fall asleep half way through the film.</string>
    <string name="leisure_timeQ5">How much time do you have each week for doing these things?</string>
    <string name="leisure_timeA5">If your asking for a specific number of hours, I guess I\’d have to say just a couple of hours per day probably.</string>
    <string name="leisure_timeQ6">Why do you like doing these activities?</string>
    <string name="leisure_timeA6">I don\’t. I mean… who would like to go back home right after work just to have a late, cold, and sometimes leftover dinner? That\’s just what I have to do since I have to work until late in the evening. I\’m not allowed to choose, that\’s the problem.</string>
    <string name="leisure_timeQ7">How did you start doing this activity at first?</string>
    <string name="leisure_timeA7">Actually, my life didn\’t used to revolve around work. A few years ago I used to lead quite a busy social life, back in university, so it took me a whole year to get used to my current lifestyle. So, I think everything has just become a routine to me now. Not in a natural way, but it has.</string>
    <string name="leisure_timeQ8">Is there some other hobby or sport you would like to try? Why?</string>
    <string name="leisure_timeA8">I\’m crazy about music and all kinds of musical instruments. It\’s such a miracle how each instrument makes a different sound, but when they\’re performed together, they can create perfect combinations of melodies. Perhaps, in the near future, I would learn about the mechanism behind this miracle. This is also a hobby, isn\’t it?</string>
    <string name="leisure_timeQ9">How do you spend your time in the evening?</string>
    <string name="leisure_timeA9">It\’s the same every day. I just keep running around in circles: going to work, coming back home, working at home, then going back to work the next morning. That\’s why the evening is, somehow, just another chance for me to satisfy my workaholic self. That\’s it.</string>
    <string name="leisure_timeQ10">Do you prefer staying at home or going out during evenings?</string>
    <string name="leisure_timeA10">It\’s like an everyday dilemma. My heart always insists me to go out and have some fun, but my mind would say no to that seemingly irrational idea. Well, my deadlines are there, my work isn\’t finished. So, most of the time, I would reluctantly stay home.</string>
    <string name="leisure_timeQ11">Do you do this every evening?</string>
    <string name="leisure_timeA11">I hate to admit, but yes, every evening when I have work left unfinished. Sometimes, I\’ve even done all my make-up and already gotten dressed. However, while waiting for my boyfriend to pick me up, I often change my mind and go back to my work instead.</string>
    <string name="leisure_timeQ12">What do you like to do on the weekends?</string>
    <string name="leisure_timeA12">As I\’ve mentioned earlier, I\’m quite a loner and I really enjoy that part of myself. So, during weekends, I would usually find something to do on my own, like redecorating my room, going to a café all alone, or just find a quiet spot in my house to do some crosswords and quizzes. I just really love to enjoy time by myself.</string>
    <string name="leisure_timeQ13">Is there any difference in your life now from when you were a child?</string>
    <string name="leisure_timeA13">This is an intriguing question, since I honestly don\’t know what to tell you. But overall, my life has changed considerably compared to what it was throughout my childhood. Everything, from my feelings, my thoughts to my relationships or accommodation, is so different now that I nearly have no recollections about the past.</string>
    <string name="leisure_timeQ14">Do you think modern lifestyles give people enough time for leisure?</string>
    <string name="leisure_timeA14">It\’s hard to say. Nowadays, people can have access to more and more entertainment facilities, and these facilities can accommodate our demands for recreation at any time. That\’s why it\’s become harder to distinguish between working hours and leisure time, which means you can\’t really tell whether the current lifestyles can give people an adequate amount of time for leisure.</string>
    <string name="leisure_timeQ15">Do you think people today have more time to relax compared to the past?</string>
    <string name="leisure_timeA15">We do have more time to relax now compared with the amount we had in the past thanks to a great number of technological advances, which are gradually replacing people\’s involvement in many fields. However, many people now are refusing to take a break, perhaps because they just don\’t want to be made redundant in the modern society.</string>
    <string name="leisure_timeQ16">What do you think is the importance of leisure time in life?</string>
    <string name="leisure_timeA16">Adequate and frequent leisure time keeps our lives balanced. What I mean is if we just stay focused on our work and study without proper relaxation, we would eventually find ourselves exhausted and may suffer from all kinds of mental conditions related to stress, like depression or bipolar disorder. So, I do believe that leisure time plays an integral part in people\’s lives.</string>
    <string name="leisure_timeQ17">Do you think old and young people spend their leisure time in the same way?</string>
    <string name="leisure_timeA17">Unfortunately, no. Family bonds would be strengthened significantly if this happened in real life. However, it\’s no surprise that the youth and the elderly hardly ever share the same interests due to the huge generation gap, so there\’s no chance they would do the same thing in their spare time. You\’re most likely to find youngsters on their phones, and on the other hand, old people would often be found doing some conventional activities for leisure like playing chess or knitting.</string>
    <string name="leisure_timeQ18">Do you like to travel in holidays?</string>
    <string name="leisure_timeA18">As long as it’s a long holiday, for example, Tet, or summer holiday. I just honestly don\’t want to go away for just 2 – 3 days because that would leave me no time to enjoy myself.</string>
    <string name="leisure_timeQ19">If you had a child, what leisure places would you go with your child?</string>
    <string name="leisure_timeA19">Well, I know children are often crazy about amusement parks and if I had children I suppose they would definitely beg me to take them there. Unfortunately, I can\’t stand crowded and noisy places, so maybe instead of that, I would take my kids to some leafy area, like a national park or botanic gardens, where we could discover more about nature.</string>

    //music
    <string name="musicQ1">Do you often listen to music?</string>
    <string name="musicA1">So far I haven\’t met anyone who dislikes music. However, when the workload is too heavy that requires me to stay highly focused, music is a huge distraction. Unlike many people who listen to instrumental music because it helps them focus,  music makes me feel sleepy.</string>
    <string name="musicQ2">When do you listen to music?</string>
    <string name="musicA2">Well, the whole world likes it, so I\’m no exception. I usually listen to cheerful music when I need motivation and prefer sad ones, when I\’m in a bad mood.</string>
    <string name="musicQ3">How much time do you spend listening to music every day?</string>
    <string name="musicA3">As I\’ve mentioned I prefer working in silence. To put it simply, I don\’t listen to music during my working hours. After a long day at school, I probably want to chill out for like half an hour and music helps me to stay energetic.</string>
    <string name="musicQ4">What kinds of music do you like to listen to?</string>
    <string name="musicA4">I prefer a range of music from Western to Eastern, and from the 90s to modern EDM. But if Korean pop is considered as a kind of music, then yeah, that\’s my favourite. More than half of my playlists are Korean songs and I always keep myself updated with news related to Korean showbiz.</string>
    <string name="musicQ5">Have you ever been to a concert before?</string>
    <string name="musicA5">I attend concerts, once in a blue moon, since the ticket price for foreign artists\’ concerts is out of my reach.  So I can only stay home and watch online. It was in 2014 that I finally did go to a concert on my own and it was an international music concert. It was absolutely mind-blowing and an unforgettable experience.</string>
    <string name="musicQ6">Do you like to listen to live music?</string>
    <string name="musicA6">Unless it\’s live at a coffee shop, where literally there is only music and me, then yeah I would love to. But I would change my mind if it\’s a concert. The crowd is too crazy. It\’s completely a mess most of the time and I end up with a severe headache.</string>
    <string name="musicQ7">When did you start listening to this type of music?</string>
    <string name="musicA7">From the day a friend of mine introduced her favourite group to me. She couldn\’t help herself talking on and on about them that I thought I somehow needed to catch up with her. And the more I got to know about Korean pop, the more passionate I became.</string>
    <string name="musicQ8">Where do you listen to it?</string>
    <string name="musicA8">Almost everywhere, except for the classroom. It\’s the golden era of mobile devices. Everyone carries earphone and phones with them all the time, music, therefore, is on their fingertips.</string>
    <string name="musicQ9">How do you feel when you listen to this music?</string>
    <string name="musicA9">Well, I\’m the type of person whose mood is easily affected by what I\’m listening to. Thus as the music changes, my mood also fluctuates. But most of the time, listening to some music helps me pick up my energy and chill a bit.</string>
    <string name="musicQ10">Have you ever learned to play a musical instrument?</string>
    <string name="musicA10">I learned to play the organ when I was in kindergarten. It was quite funny because I started out as one of the performers. Then my teacher told my mom that I had better play the organ instead of performing. So I became her trainee and it continued for around 4 to 5 years until I was 10.</string>
    <string name="musicQ11">Is music an important subject at school in your country?</string>
    <string name="musicA11">Music is one of the compulsory subjects for primary and secondary students in my country. However, the main focus was on singing. We could also add some movements to make the songs more lively. Only those who were selected for the large performances were allowed to use musical instruments.</string>
    <string name="musicQ12">Did you often listen to music when you were a child?</string>
    <string name="musicA12">Since my parents are music-lovers and also have very good tastes, I was exposed to music at a very young age. Sometimes my mom sang me to sleep with her lullabies. Although I could not get the message at that time, my mom said that I buoyed up when listening to them.</string>
    <string name="musicQ13">What kinds of music are (most) popular in your country?</string>
    <string name="musicA13">Besides pop music, the younger generation nowadays is exposed to different types of music. It is indeed difficult to tell which is in-demand since I feel each type has roughly the same popularity. But I guess pop music is the most sought-after now. I\’ve never met someone who doesn\’t know pop songs.</string>
    <string name="musicQ14">Do you like traditional songs?</string>
    <string name="musicA14">Well, it\’s easy for me to name some traditional songs, some of which I\’m very familiar with. But to be honest, I think I\’m not that into this kind of music.</string>

    //shopping
    <string name="shoppingQ1">Do you like shopping?</string>
    <string name="shoppingA1">Yeah, I do like shopping a lot since it helps us to get new stuffs for ourselves all the time.</string>
    <string name="shoppingQ2">What\’s your favourite shop?</string>
    <string name="shoppingA2">I really like clothing shops since the items there are very decorative and eye-catching items, and it comes with different types of items for which you would like to take any and makes shopping difficult for you.</string>
    <string name="shoppingQ3">Do you prefer shopping alone or with others?</string>
    <string name="shoppingA3">Shopping with someone has always been my most preferred way to shop since you would not be left alone and also would definitely get someone you trust with you to help you make choices.</string>
    <string name="shoppingQ4">What kinds of shops are there where you live?</string>
    <string name="shoppingA4">I live in a rural area, and there are not many shops around, but we have book shops, electrical and clothing shops</string>
    <string name="shoppingQ5">Have you ever bought anything online?</string>
    <string name="shoppingA5">Yeah, I did buy an SD Card once from an online store that was recommended to me by a friend.</string>
    <string name="shoppingQ6">Do you think men and women have different opinions about shopping?</string>
    <string name="shoppingA6">Definitely, because men would like to get themselves a few items to change their wardrobe or the likes, but ladies always want to change their whole wardrobe.</string>
    <string name="shoppingQ7">Do you enjoy shopping?</string>
    <string name="shoppingA7">Yes, I\’m a massive fan of shopping. Actually, I\’d say that I\’m a bit of a shopaholic. I absolutely love to try on and buy new clothes. I used to go on shopping sprees every month, but because I was spending too much money, I had to cut down. </string>
    <string name="shoppingQ8">What are your favorite stores?</string>
    <string name="shoppingA8">As mentioned, I\’ve become more frugal, so I tend to go for reasonably-priced high-street stores.I suppose my favorite shop is HM. It\’s good value for money and they always stock the latest trends.</string>
    <string name="shoppingQ9">Have you bought anything online?</string>
    <string name="shoppingA9">Yes, I have purchased some gadgets. Last year, I bought my phone from an online retailer as it was much better value there than in a brick and mortar store.  I\'d like to buy clothes online, but I\’m always afraid that when delivered, they won\’t fit me.</string>

    <string name="part2ActivityA01">My family is good at cooking since we always think it is better to have home cooked food, and usually have big feasts on the weekends. However, I would like to talk about the time when my family gathered to make Chung cake for the Tet holiday. The Lunar New Year, or Tet, was a very special traditional holiday in my country. It was probably my favourite holiday when I was a small boy, as my family did a lot of activities to celebrate this occasion. Among them, making Chung cake excited me the most. Traditionally, we always made Chung Cake two days before the Lunar New Year. We had a big yard behind our house, and the Chung cake was made there, from preparing ingredients, to shaping the cake to cook it. I still remember having helped my parents prepare the cake\’s ingredients while my elder brother was in charge of shaping the cake. And then, my father lit a small fire to boil the cake overnight. It was perhaps the only time of the year when I was allowed to stay up late. In recent years, my family has not had enough time to make Chung cake on our own. However, a ready-made Chung cake that we buy from a local market cannot bring the same special feelings and replace the taste of a Chung cake made at home. I hope that my family can continue our tradition in the coming years</string>
    <string name="part2ActivityA02">There was a time in college where my classmates and I were supposed to enter a competition called Wall Magazine. There were a few prerequisites to register for it. We had to be a team of eight students and we had to generate the ideas to be put up on the wall, and it had to be illustrated visually for the competition. We were given the entire summer to prepare for it. The area of the college wall, assigned to our team, had to be ready by the time the classes resumed after the holidays. As any team activity has its challenges and perks, we had to face a lot of snags during our work as well. Overall, I would say that it was a fun-filled brainstorming, but we had our shares of resistance and disagreements during the workflow. We had decided to exhibit the effects of climate change, and we vividly illustrated it with paintings, writings, constructs, quotations, cut-outs relating to climate change from various print media sources. One of our team members felt so inspired by the work done halfway, that she suggested if we could show up a destructive impression starting from the edge of the wall space we were working on. An impression of devastating forests and melting glaciers posing a threat to human was depicted by just two members of our team who took almost a week, working with paints and colours to bring out the idea and it was true to life. The teamwork gave us time to implore our deeds and made us ponder on how negative and unhelpful we were towards Mother Nature. It was indeed an unforgettable activity as it instilled in all of us, a feeling of compassion and above all, the unity that we could constructively use.</string>
    <string name="part2ActivityA03">I like to remain active, both physically and mentally, by enjoying different kinds of activities. Such activities may include spending time with all of my friends (and trust me, I have plenty of them) to enjoying some video games all by myself, and any other activities in between. But, today, I would like to talk about an activity which is a little unique in the sense that not too many people do that. The name of this activity, I would like to talk about, is “video recording” – video recording of different kinds of interesting and unique TV programmes when I don\’t have anything else to do. In fact, I have been enjoying this activity for more than 7 or 8 years since the time I started my career as a Media Communication Specialist at one of the leading advertising firms in my country. By the way, one of the things, which I have to do as a Media Communication Specialist, is to understand and explain the visual effects of different kinds of TV programmes, especially, the programmes like drama, serials and advertisements. In other words, I needed to watch a lot a TV sometimes for professional purpose. But, as I kept doing that, I suddenly figured out that TV programmes change in their costumes and styles in the course of time, even though, they air basically the same kind of programmes with the same kinds of substances and messages. And that\’s when I also figured out that these changes, which both can be very subtle and visible, could be preserved as some great source of reference and information about the fashion and styles of a certain period of time or age. Anyway, I enjoy doing this activity because it allows me to compare the different kinds of communication styles and the qualities of different kinds of TV programmes through the prism of time. It also allows me to recall some of the good memories of the past that are associated with watching a certain kind of programmes. I think that more people should take this activity as one of their favourite pass time activity.</string>
    <string name="part2ActivityA04">Until recently, I would remain happy to just sit at home and watch some TV after work. Now, while I have nothing against enjoying our time at home, this thing turned into a rather boring affair for me after a while.  In other words, I needed to find some other kinds of activities. So, I went to a store one day about 6 months ago and bought myself a bicycle. Well, the reason for buying this bicycle was – yes, you have guessed it right – to tussle with it a little after work. Of course, it was not the first time that I ever owned a bicycle and rode it. In fact, I used to own a very nice looking “two-wheeler” and ride it like a “pro” (“pro” as in “professional” here) when I was attending my university about 10 years ago. But, then, when I started a career, which required a different kind of lifestyle from my end, I had to give up the idea of riding a bicycle. But, now, once again, I have gone back to my “old self”, a more adventurous one in that, while enjoying this activity after my work, or I should say, mainly after my work, in the afternoon, since I also happen to ride it in the morning during the weekends, some times.  But, no matter, when or at what time, I am doing this activity, I always try to do it in a nearby park, since they are comparatively less crowded or busy than those city roads or streets. And yes, I enjoy this activity alone, even though it would be nice to have other fellow riders to accompany me sometimes. But, riding alone or not, I am really enjoying this rather new activity since it allows me to become and behave like the “young me” once again!  I am also feeling a way more “liberated” and positive about myself after starting this activity because it helps me take my mind away from the “toxic” work environment that I have to cope with sometimes.</string>
    <string name="part2ActivityA05">Usually, I participate in almost all the activities of my college and recently my classmates organised an outdoor picnic and I participated in that. It was all of a sudden and all the classmates agreed on arranging a picnic. All of us contributed on the picnic so that we could but the necessary food and other items. The venue was selected adjacent to out college in Mumbai. Basically, the idea emerged from observing a birthday party of one of my classmates. But instead of celebrating the birthday inside the classroom, I proposed to make it a picnic in outdoor and everyone present there positively nodded with my proposal and immediately started arranging the picnic. When I submitted the proposal for the outdoor picnic, it appeared that many of them have not been attending an outdoor picnic for so long. Then we collected the contributory money to arrange the picnic and three of the boys went shopping the necessary things. By the time, two of the girls went to their home to bring the cooking ports. The rest went to the spot near Mumbai sea beach. It was almost noon when the others reached the selected spot with the cooking pots and materials. We took water buckets, plates, glasses, water containers and stoves to the spot. Cooking was assigned to the girls of the class and traditional food items were cooked in the picnic. Moreover, a birthday cake was brought to celebrate the birthday of Nitish, the birthday boy for aiming whom we have arranged the picnic. Since I proposed for the picnic, they assigned me with all the responsibilities to coordinate the picnic. Thereby, I had to be highly busy and got occupied with all the activities. I selected members for purchasing the food items from the local market while I also advised the girls to bring some cooking pots and stove from their respective house and accordingly they brought all the necessary items. All of them were puzzled about the spot selection while I suggested that we could go near the sea beach which is not far away from the college. Moreover, the idea of having a birthday cake was my invention. I am highly pleased that I have participated in the arrangement of the picnic and could make it a successful one. Due to the mechanised nature of our daily life, we cannot make our body and mind free from stress and anxiety. A sudden outing with the friends and near or dear ones really helps to get relief from the dullness of the life. The picnic we made was entirely unexpected and enjoyable too. But we had to miss all the classes on that day and we, in fact, do not bother about the issue as we all informed our respective teachers about the sudden outing near the sea beach.</string>
    <string name="part2ActivityA06">I would like to talk about one of my favourite activities on the beach, swimming. You know, I live in Hai Phong, a coastal city with golden beaches and the nearest seashore is just fifteen minutes from my house. So, in the summer, my friends and I often go there and swim in the cool water to avoid the hot weather. Actually, swimming is a relatively easy sport. I learned how to swim when I was about 8 years old and it took me only a week to get familiar with a number of swimming strokes, like breaststroke, backstroke and butterfly. Before entering the water, I often warm up and stretch my muscles and joints to avoid any injuries, then put on my swimsuit and jump right in. I really enjoy swimming on the beach because of a few reasons. Firstly, unlike other water sports such as diving or windsurfing, which require costly equipment, swimming costs nothing. Secondly, swimming is extremely beneficial to our health. It provides an all-over body workout, as nearly all of our muscles are used during swimming. It also builds endurance, muscle strength and cardiovascular fitness. Lastly, going swimming is a good means of recreation as it allows me to unwind, alleviate stress and have a great time with my friends. Summer is coming so I\’ll definitely make a plan to visit the beach soon. I intend to go to Nha Trang beach as it\’s considered as one of the most magnificent beaches in the world.</string>
    <string name="part2ActivityA07">I believe doing things or activities when we are alone or free has many benefits. It helps in keeping the mind busy, additionally one can develop his/her skills and any activity becomes more enjoyable when a person does it with enthusiasm. Today, I would like to talk about an activity that I do when I am by myself. I love to collect photographs especially of my loved ones. I got this habit from one of my school friends as she had extraordinary talent to make a scrapbook. I got this passion from her as everyone appreciated her work and I liked it a lot as well. I have bought a digital camera as well using which I click a lot of candid pictures of my family and friends. Then, whenever I get leisure time after accomplishing my day\’s work, I organise all photographs into a collage. This helps me to retain the memories and presence of all my favourite people. It is part of my daily life now as it helps me to connect with them. This activity gets me a lot of accolades as when any special occasion comes such as Birthdays ,wedding anniversary I gift these pictures to my loved one\’s. I get these pictures framed before giving them as gifts. I feel in today\’s materialistic world everyone is getting detached due to social media and Internet. This small activity makes me feel connected with the people who are important in my life and helps in strengthening my relationship with them. It is also an activity which gives me immense joy and pleasure. I would say that this activity is my stress buster and I enjoy doing it when I am alone.</string>
    <string name="part2ActivityA08">There are copious activities which I do on a regular basis to keep myself fit, and also I ensure that I have suitable physical well-being and those activities include running jogging swimming and other sports activities how about the most favourite one. I feel that it really energizes me is working out in the gym, wake up early in the morning, around 6:00. I just spent 4 miles, and fresh up after that, I would hit the gym. It\’s actually in my apartment, so it is just a 5-minute walk from my residence to relax and rejuvenate. I feel energetic throughout the day, and post, my session starts with light exercises such as on treadmill data, followed by some severe running with the highest speed limit on the same treadmill. I would lift some weights and it ladies from 1 kg to 5 kgs it actually at first I was back I was suffering from back pain. I was also obese, so I considered a doctor. He suggested that I have to take part in some physical activity, so I got the motivation after a good target. After that, I started hitting the gym on a regular basis. Now I\’m able to maintain my health, and I feel that I am healthy, way healthier than I was before, and I need to continue this for us as possible. </string>
    <string name="part2ActivityA09">Well, life has become extremely fast and busy, and people often complain that they are short on time, yet we waste a lot of time intentionally or unintentionally. Here I would like to talk about an activity that I do regularly, and it wastes my hours easily. The fact is that I am quite active on social media, which is more like a weed these days. It is a more practical way to remain in touch with friends and relatives as it saves a lot of time and energy when compared to meeting others personally. But sometimes, I feel I waste too much time on this. Firstly, I have a huge network of friends who are active on different apps like Whatsapp, Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, and others, and for their sake, I always have to remain active on these platforms. In addition, people sometimes share posts unduly and always expect from others to comment, and a few of my friends are so obsessed that they get angry with me if I don\’t comment in time. Similarly, every second day is someone\’s birthday, and I have to spare time to wish them. Moreover, these platforms are bombarded with extremely tempting advertisements, and once I get on these sites to check anything, I end up wasting a lot of time. I feel very bad because now I am kind of addicted to using these platforms. I can utilize this time more productively than I waste here unduly. So, this is an activity that I do regularly, which wastes a lot of time of mine.</string>
    <string name="part2ActivityA10">Day off is a rare thing for me due to my occupational engagement. I am a gymnasium instructor by profession and thus I have to remain busy round the week or month. If I could get a day off, suddenly, I will do only a single thing. Though there a wide number of tasks to pass a day off, I will follow a different idea. I like to watch Hollywood movies and in fact, I am a fan of action and drama movies made in Hollywood. So, when I will get the day off, I would like to watch movies. I have a huge collection of DVDs but I cannot enjoy those for the want of time. I have a plan to watch as much of the movies possible in a single day. Thus, I have accumulated the movies and waiting for an unexpected day off from the role of a gym instructor. Watching movies is fun when you will have companies. But in this case, I would like to watch the movie at my residence where nobody could reach me. The taste of watching movies alone is also different. I have a small living room at my home which is decorated with a nice set of sofa, a television, and a few small chairs. I will play the movie on the television with the DVD player and sit back on the sofa. This is my own special style for watching movies. I try to have a comfortable position and thus move my legs frequently while I am sitting on the sofa. Sometimes I bend my legs and sit on the sofa and some other times I keep the legs straight and touching the ground. To watch the movies, I will need a personal computer to play the movies. But a television set with a DVD player will also do the same. Though I have a personal computer, it is located in my bedroom and I cannot bring it in the living room for lack of space. So, I will use the television set with the DVD player. The television set hangs on the wall while the DVD player is connected to the television with a cable. Besides, I will also need a set of large amplifiers. Usually, small amplifiers cannot create a loud environment which is a must for enjoying movies. Sometimes, I may in need of snacks, so enough snacks should be with me during the movie watching hours. Life is getting busier. Managing extra times for leisure is rare in the current days. With the modernization of the civilisation, people are getting engaged with their respective activities. So, they cannot perform the desired things they want to do. I am also like the other common people who are always busy. So, having a day off is of great importance to me. Despite being a movie lover, I cannot manage enough time to enjoy movies. Due to my engagement with the gymnasium, I have to be occupied. A good number of people come to the gym at different times of the day and I have to instruct them accordingly. So, if I could get the day off, it would be of great help to me. It will allow me enjoying the movies that I have been longing to watch for a long time.</string>

    //part2 answer advertisements
    <string name="part2AdvertisementA01">Last week, I was quite free since it was weekend and was watching television for enjoying my leisure time. I was switching channels to look for an interesting program when suddenly my eyes got stuck on a TV channel that was advertising a hair product. It was promoting a shampoo which colors hair as well. It was a newly launched product in the market to assist the youngsters and adults who need to dye their hair. When I watched that advertisement, I did not switch to any other channel and kept on watching it carefully. The way it was being promoted with the attractive visuals and discount offers, I liked that advertisement a lot. The most important thing that attracted me towards that advertisement was the fact that the advertised dye product colours hair differently. Usually, when we apply dye, we have to keep it for around 15 minutes and then we wash our hair while we use shampoo separately to wash hair. But this dye product was unique since it does two functions together. It is in the form of shampoo which can be applied to your hair like any other hair shampoo. You just need to keep it for 10 minutes and then you can wash your hair. Moreover, there is no need to apply any other shampoo for washing hair as it is used for that purpose also. Since it was bringing so much advantage for me, I immediately made an order and bought it from the company.</string>
    <string name="part2AdvertisementA02">Most of the time, I think that advertisements are just a waste of time because they don\’t really do any good for the general public. But, then, suddenly we come across an advertisement, which forces us to think otherwise, just as I was also forced to think like that about a couple of years ago. It is an advertisement about “tea” – drinking tea that is. By the way, I would say that it was one of the best advertisements I had ever seen in a long, long time, as it was made in a very clear manner to deliver a clear message in the form of having some light jokes and conversation. I saw this advertisement on television for the first time about a year ago or so. In the advertisement, a stage is perfectly set for an enjoyable evening for 4 people, including two wives and two husbands. They were all busy talking and laughing with each other while enjoying some snacks at the same time. Then, it was time for some hot tea in order to conclude the evening time to get together for the day.  So, anyway, when everybody was busy pouring sugar into their cup full of tea while zooming in on the brand name of the tea, they noticed that one of the wives was not taking any sugar. When asked, why the lady was not taking any sugar, she smilingly answered that she always likes to keep her sugar and husband under control. After that joke, everybody burst out in laughter.  And, with that laughter, the advertisement was concluded. Anyway, I really like the advertisement and find it effective, mainly because it is trying to deliver a very clear message to its audience about controlling their sugar consumption also in order to check their diabetes while enjoying their tasty tea as much as they can. I like the advertisement also because it revealed a very sweet but age-old rivalry between a husband and wife as to "who gets to control who" in a romantic relationship.</string>
    <string name="part2AdvertisementA03">Every day we watch several advertisements on TV and computers whether we like to watch them or not. And some of these adverts are simply dull, some are average while a few of them are very interesting and creative. One such advertisement that I really liked was about the unmatched contributions of mothers to their children, and I really liked the theme of this advertisement. I watched it a few months ago. The advertisement was broadcast for "Mother\'s Day" and it was not for promoting any product or service. The ministry of child and mother care of the health department was the sponsor of this advert, and I saw it 3–4 days before last Mother\'s Day. This advert was a very creative one, and it was not like most other ads that publicise or advertise their products or boast about their service. Rather it was dedicated to the mothers, and it reminded us of a fact that we all know. It outlined that the toughest job in the world is the job of a mother. Mothers do everything humanly possible to offer the best to their infants. They sacrifice their own happiness and time to properly take care of the kids. What they do is not comparable to anything or anyone in the world. Without their love, our survival would have been impossible. I saw this advert in the (say a TV channel name) channel. This was a creative ad that effectively delivered the message it intended to, which was to remind us of our mother\'s importance and love in our life. It showed some successful people, and before that, it showed how mothers were taking care and inspiring their kids to do good in life. It was an advertisement dedicated to all mothers in the world.</string>
    <string name="part2AdvertisementA04">We see several types of advertisements on TV, billboards, on the Internet, social networking sites, mobile applications, and mobile games on a regular basis. Many of them are very banal, full of marketing speech and are kind of boring while others are average and their primary focus is to express the positive sides of a product to increase their sales. Finally, quite a few of them are creative, informative, humorous, fascinating and memorable. I usually do not like to watch advertisements while watching a movie or a TV programme as they distract me from the excitement of the movie or the show. In fact, lengthier commercial breaks are quite annoying to me. I personally think that the best way of advertising for companies or brands is using billboards, which make people remember the brand name. One of the best advertisements that I have ever seen and still like was a billboard advertisement on a highway in the United Arab Emirates. One day while passing the main road, a big billboard caught my eyes. It was designed to look like the filtration zone of a cigarette which is commonly known as the cigarette butt. The large billboard was quite different in shape and it presented the message "Stop smoking even Marlboro" quite visibly. I stole a glance at the billboard and thought about the message it conveyed. I actually did not think much and forgot about it. After an hour or so, I found myself in front of a beach with a packet of Marlboro cigarettes in my pocket. While I was lighting a cigarette, I was wondering why I bought a packet of Marlboro? It is usually not my brand! To my surprise, I realised that the advertisement that I saw on the road had an immense effect on my psychology unconsciously. I was convinced that the billboard had forced me to buy that brand unconsciously. I think it was the first time I realised how advertisements can target people\'s unconscious minds. Technically speaking this is the moment I realised that the best way to influence people\’s buying behaviour is to use their unconscious mind instead of trying to deliver marketing speeches. When I thought more to analyse the billboard advertising and its effect on me, I realised that the advertiser tried to use reverse advertising techniques by delivering the message that Marlboro is less dangerous and smokers who wish to quit smoking should try this. Possibly all smokers - from light smokers to heavy ones wish for a day without smoking though many of them do not try hard. Then the billboard advertisement was pretending as if they were broadcasting an important public safety message. Moreover, they used a fascinating design on the billboard that would actually grab anyone\'s attention. As you can see, they were quite successful as I still remember this advert very vividly and I like this advertisement due to the creative thinking of the maker of this advertisement.</string>
    <string name="part2AdvertisementA05">Here is the sample for “Describe an Advertisement which you found very persuasive” topic Undoubtedly, the advent of social media has given a duly kick to advertisers and promoters worldwide. These days, we can find ourselves surrounded by persuasive promotions on almost every channel, whether offline or online. In my opinion, I find TV advertisements to be more informative and gripping than the ones appearing on social media. Last week, I came across an ad on TV by Samsung wherein the brand was promoting their latest release – the Samsung Galaxy S21. In the advertisement, a young lady seemingly was on a road trip with her friends where she used the Samsung Galaxy S21 to record her surroundings and click pictures of her friends. I found the concept enthralling; hence, I decided not to change the channel and watch it till the end. Also, alongside the lady trying to capture everything, the brand had listed out the specifications and essential features of the phone. The beauty and elegant design of the phone were highlighted, which impressed me greatly. This advertisement pinpointed everything required to know to buy this phone, from the display size to the battery capacity. Since I was planning to upgrade my phone to a newer version, I was influenced by this commercial. Post the advertisement, I instantly searched for more features and pricing of the phone on the internet. I liked almost everything about it; thus, I ordered one myself. All in all, I can state that the TV advertisements are influential, at least for me, as I ended up making this significant purchase merely because of a commercial.</string>
    <string name="part2AdvertisementA06">We have been bombarded with an array of advertisements every single day. Whether it is a newspaper, television or social media like Facebook or LinkedIn, advertising always has its own way to reach us. One of the most frequent pieces of advertising I have encountered these past few days was about [tech event in your country 2018]. As an avid Facebook user, I scroll down my newsfeeds board practically every 30 minutes to stay abreast of every latest action within my social network. Admittedly, there are some better things I can do but I just can\'t help myself. Therefore, the fact that the ads about [tech event in your country 2018] repeatedly popped up on my newsfeed really caught my attention. Some of my friends also shared this news. It piqued my interest so much that I paid a visit to their website to figure out what their gig was. As far as I am concerned, it is a 2-day international technology and investment event for entrepreneurs and business leaders. It is appealing not only to big tech companies but tech-savvy individuals as well. The event aims to reach out to foreign investors, raising funding opportunities, and developing the tech and startup community in an era where tech disruptions are leading almost every industry. With some of the most brilliant and world-class speakers, attendees are going to get some food for thought and inspiration during and after the event. For me, it was a really useful ad because this big tech event was a golden opportunity for young and talented engineers, developers and entrepreneurs who are thriving non-stop toward a better future, a better life within [your country] and beyond. If I am able to schedule my time and afford the tickets, I will definitely be there to enjoy the vibe and explore many potentials in this rising industry.</string>

    //part2 answer animal
    <string name="part2AnimalA01">I like all animals in general, but I think my favorite would be a dog. A dog is a domestic animal and can be seen in almost all houses and streets of my country. The best part about dogs is that apart from being a great keeper, they also shower love on their owners. A person owning a dog gets love and care from the dog and the dog makes sure that no one harms his or her owner. Although, most people like dogs, everyone has different choices as there are various breeds of dogs such as pugs, a golden retriever, bulldog, and German shepherd etc. Interestingly, the characteristics of dogs depend on their breed. For instance, a bulldog is more aggressive than a pug and is more likely to bite you. Even more, the food requirements vary with breed. As a matter of fact, a smaller breed would require more energy and food than a larger or a medium-sized breed. One needs to know the breed of the dog and provide the food accordingly. A dog surely becomes a part of the family and often it has been seen that they get weak in the absence of their owners. The connection between dogs and humans is almost electric and I believe one must surely have one.</string>
    <string name="part2AnimalA02">Earth is full of different creatures and various organisms. Humans are the top of the food chain on this planet and share the planet with other living organisms. Animals form a big part of our ecosystem and help us preserve nature and restore balance in the ecosystem. There are various majestic creatures that inhabit our lands but the one that fascinates me the most are snow leopards. Snow leopards are solitary creatures and they are found in the entire Himalayan range and central Asia. These beasts are a thing of beauty and their distinctive fur and color easily differentiate them from an African or Asian leopard. Their coat is white and grey in color and it helps them camouflage with local surroundings. Their thick coat helps them stay warm in chilling Himalayan weather. They are very shy creatures and perhaps that is the reason why very less is known about their behavior and habitat. Their diet mostly consists of antelopes and Himalayan goats that are found in abundance in the mountainous terrain. Sadly the human-animal conflict has caught up with these beautiful animals too and today they are considered as critically endangered by the World Wild Life Federation. There are less than 5000 snow leopards out in the wild and drastic measures are being taken to conserve their numbers. There is a famous documentary recently made by the BBC and its titled Blue planet. The crew filmed for almost 4 extensive years and captured some great footage of the majestic creatures. For the first time in history, they were able to capture footage of a snow leopard making a kill. I feel sad that we as humans are not doing enough to protect these animals and are adamant upon destroying their habitat</string>
    <string name="part2AnimalA03">I would like to tell you about an opportunity that I met a white tiger which is one of the star attractions in Singapore Zoo during my last summer vacation. I was recommended to see white tiger first due to its rarity and uncommon beauty. Its habitat is landscaped to resemble a dense jungle. I was truly attracted and felt excited at the first sight by its gorgeous appearance. This giant cat has blue eyes, pink nose, and creamy white fur covered with brown stripes. In the wild, this animal\’s diet consists of monkeys, birds and other animals as it is a carnivore. It also prefers killing young, weak or old animals because they cannot run as fast and are often left alone by their herd. In the zoo, it is fed by animal\’s meat even including imported meat namely Kangaroo\’s meat. At the beginning I felt scared a little bit because tigers are well – known for a dangerous species as well as the King of animals. However after encountering this white tiger, I changed my mind since it was very cute and friendly to human. As tigers in general and white tigers in particular are endangered species, I suggest that people should make a great effort to preserve them.</string>
    <string name="part2AnimalA04">For the longest time now, one of my cousins has been pleading with me to visit her. I was extremely held up in my professional commitments that I could not make time to visit her at all. And then, one weekend, after her consistent persistence, I decided to finally pay her a visit. I packed my bag and gave her a surprise. I spent some quality time with her, gossiping, talking about our private lives, and just clicking pictures. In the evening, one of her friends dropped by. However, she was not alone but was accompanied by a Skye Terrier. It was one of the most distinctive-looking dog breeds. It was extremely elegant and heavy. It would have been around 9 or 10 inches high. It featured a flat-lying, long coat and peekaboo hairdo. The dog was massive and had feathery ears that stood up like bat wings every time I called its name. It had muscular, short legs, so it walked quiet slowly. However, when I threw a ball, the dog ran at lightning speed. In terms of nature, the dog was extremely affectionate. It let me pat and rub the coat like we had known each other for years. Upon talking to my cousin\’s friend, I got to know that the dog was friendly with other dogs as well. Looking at it, one thing that I realized was it surely isn\’t easy to take care of a pet, especially if the breed is rare</string>
    <string name="part2AnimalA05">For a long time, my closest friend was behind me to visit his house. Not feeling comfortable in spending the entire day, and probably a night, at his house, I kept declining his offer. Then suddenly, one morning, he dropped by my house to pick me up. I had to give in this time and go along. Upon reaching his house, there were a few things that left my jaw dropped. However, what excited me the most was that he had an Alaskan dog. One of the largest domestic dog\’s breeds, it had a double coat. The undercoat was extremely soft while the outer one was waterproof and coarse. Also, he was black and white in colour, which made him look even more mesmerized. His most attractive feature was the small, upright ears that were slightly out of proportion. His blue eyes made him look intriguing. I spent an entire day with him and found out that he learnt quickly; thus, he was quite smart. While playing, I threw the ball for him to fetch. Initially, he looked clueless but soon caught up with my tricks. I threw a few more objects afterward, and he chased all of them successfully, retrieved them, and brought them back. It seemed like he understood everything intrinsically. Since I met him for the first time, it didn\’t seem odd. He was quite a friendly animal and tried spreading the love all around. I always wanted to have a dog of my own, but my mother didn\'t allow it because of the congested space. But it looks like it is time to convince my mother and get a pet</string>
    <string name="part2AnimalA06">When I was in primary school, one day our teacher announced that we were going on a field trip. I got pretty excited about the prospects of spending the whole day in the woods. I was six or seven then and we lived in the city, so I wouldn\'t see much of the trees and the nature, let alone animals in their natural habitat. When the day came we set off. The summer sun makes everything better and our trip was no exception. It took us about two hours to drive to our camping spot. As we were unpacking, I noticed a hare sitting in tall grass, watching us. I took a piece of fruit and slowly approached it. I guess it really wanted to dash away, but the smell of the treat was too much to resist. It approached me cautiously, but wouldn\'t get closer than five feet. I ended up just leaving the fruit for it to nibble on. Seeing the hare made me really think about the relationship between humans and animals. I guess it was used to seeing people around, that is why it showed curiosity and was brave enough to approach us. I wonder if I would be lucky enough to see any wild animals there nowadays</string>
    <string name="part2AnimalA07">I am not exactly a “pet-friendly” person, so I never really owned any pet before. But, I don\'t mind other people having pets as long as they teach their pets how to behave. Today, I would like to talk about one such good pet – as in a properly trained pet dog called peddle – which used to be owned by someone, I knew a long time ago. The pet, I am talking about, was a special kind of dog called poodle. It was a standard size white poodle, with a height of about 50 centimetres and over 20 inches at the shoulder. Not sure, how old it really was, but I saw it live in my neighbourhood for about 5 years. However, I would assume that the poodle wasn\'t really that old because I found him to be busy and active almost always in the streets of my neighbourhood. I am not really an expert on the dog or any kind of pet, but I thought that the poodle was of a gentle breed since I had seldom heard any barking from it except on some occasions when the weather was rainy and/or windy. I also liked the fact it would never fight with other dogs or animals. In fact, if anything, it actually liked to play with other animals like cats and cattle. It even used to play with the little birds sometimes without ever trying to harm them. By the way, this dog didn\'t really need that much care except an exercise of about 40 minutes on a daily basis and some routine grooming. Besides, I don\'t really think that the poodle ate that much food except some dry dog foods and some occasional rice-chicken diet. Anyway, the poodle is a popular type of pet because they are mostly good family dogs — fun, energetic, smart and easy to train. And, they would never disappoint us if we want to take some exercise outside and enjoy some outdoor activities. After all, they are very sociable and playful dogs, and they even like to play with the cats! All in all, it is a good pet to have at our home.</string>
    <string name="part2AnimalA08">It is a very long time since I had a pet!  However, when we were small my sister and I did both have pets, I\'m going to tell you all about them. What kind of animal, how we looked after them, why we liked them and what makes them to this day a popular children\'s pet. The animal in question was a guinea pig! My sister and I had one each, mine was called Treacle, and her\'s was called Toffee. They were father and son, Treacle was the older guinea pig and Toffee was a bit younger. Despite their name, guinea pigs are neither from Guinea and nor are they related to pigs. They are rodents, with distinctive front teeth, they are quite small, compact, rounded creatures, fur-covered, with short legs and no tail. They are also highly social, I think they come from South America, and "naturally" would live in groups of up to ten individuals so it is really important they are kept with others when in captivity or they become very stressed and unhappy. The guinea pigs lived together in a shared hutch in the garden. They weren\'t difficult to look after, but they did need a lot of daily care. First thing in the morning we would open the hutch and let the guinea pigs out so they could run around the garden. They never strayed very far, and kept the lawn beautifully short, they ate grass in preference to any of the planted flowers. Whilst they were running around we would clean out the hutch every day. The hutch was in two parts, an enclosed sleeping area, and a larger living area with a wire mesh side. We would take everything out in the morning and replace it with new bedding. First a layer of sawdust and then newspaper covered by lots of soft fresh hay in the sleeping area so it was warm and cosy. Then in the living area, we would scatter a deep layer of sawdust before putting out fresh food, a mixture of vegetables – carrots and cabbage, together with a special guinea pig food we brought from the pet food shop which contained grains like crushed maize as well as grass pellets. They also had a water bottle hanging up which we filled up freshly each day. The guinea pigs spent all day in the garden, but as evening fell they would put themselves to bed in their hutch. Last thing at night we would check they were safe and well, and lock them in and pull a cover down over the front of the hutch.  This kept them warm and dry even if the weather was bad and protected them in case foxes might visit at night. I loved my guinea pig. He was a beautiful warm chestnut colour. He had sort of rosette shapes in his coat – not like smooth-haired guinea pigs which I think are more usual today. I liked to cuddle him, which he tolerated, but honestly, when I look back I don\'t know if he really enjoyed it as much as I did. Poor Treacle. He and his brother Toffee were very talkative. They made a delightful squeaking and chattering noise when they were excited – for example when they could hear you were on your way over to feed them. Guinea pigs are really good pets I think. They are gentle and not too difficult to look after. However, it\'s really important they have the companionship of the same species, a proper diet, fresh food and water every day and lots of room to move about. They are incredibly active, running around for about 20 hours each day. Having a pet is a big responsibility, but I think I learned a lot from looking after our guinea pigs. You have to care for them every day, and that is an important lesson for a child to learn. Sadly, in time they grew old and died. We were very upset, but that was perhaps a useful life lesson too. I gained a lot from my friendship with Treacle, but even so, I worry about animals being kept as pets, they are not all looked after as well as they should be. If children are given pets, I think it\'s really important they know how to care for them properly and that an adult is around to supervise, then everyone can be satisfied that the animal is safe and well and that the children and pets are both as happy as each other!</string>
    <string name="part2AnimalA09">My uncle had a dog almost 10 years ago and we called it Dave. We stayed at our uncle\'s house for about 6 months at that time and I often played with Dave. This dog was around 2 years old and very fond of us. We used to feed him and that\'s why he became so close to us. My uncle placed it at a pet training centre when it was 1 year old. So he was a dog who needed a little care. We used to bath him 3 – 4 times a week. He was very choosy about his sleeping place and we needed to make him a cosy dog room. When he became sick, we needed to take him to the nearest pet hospital. We used to tie him with a belt him sometimes when we took him to unknown places. Mostly keeping him clean and dry was the care he needed most. I liked the pet very much mostly because of the way he treated us. Whenever I returned home he came to me and acted so fondly. It seemed like he understood my moods and gestures and acted accordingly. I liked the pet because he was a good accompany</string>

    //part 2 Clothes answers
    <string name="part2ClothesA01">Most of the time, I prefer to dress in comfortable clothes and feel at ease.  For the majority of special occasions, therefore, I like to wear smart but casual trousers, white blouses and sometimes a jacket. From time to time, when the social event I attend requires a higher level of formality, suits, and formal shoes would be indispensable items for my overall appearance. Well, most of my casual clothes, even the smart ones, come from markets and common fashion brands, like Zara or H and M, because they are relatively affordable. However, I do set higher standards for my formal clothes, especially in terms of the materials. Therefore, I occasionally buy some quality white blouses from a first-class fashion brand. I have sometimes bought clothes online for special occasions, but I prefer to try them on and see the quality myself.  I have to admit that I also like the wide range of choice in the shops. I prefer the combination of a blouse and formal trousers to wearing a dress or trying to keep up with the latest fashions, for several reasons, one of which is probably my character. Despite being a girl, I am more into comfortable clothes and find wearing dresses or skirts fairly uncomfortable. Besides, a white blouse is suitable for people of any age or gender and almost all occasions. Normally, formal clothes would make you look more mature, but a combination of a white blouse with trousers gives you a smart yet youthful look. All of my family members like to see me wearing formal clothes, as the outfit adds a few years to my natural features. For others, I think this look is perfectly suitable because it shows my politeness and respect for the events I attend. However, I think that my friends prefer to see me in elegant, feminine dresses, as a girl in a white blouse may not impress others. I prefer to dismiss these traditional ideas. Provided that I dress smartly for special occasions, I like to choose clothes to please myself, rather than wear the clothes that others would choose if they were me.</string>
    <string name="part2ClothesA02">India is a nation of customs and traditions. Therefore, the clothes we wear on special occasions are unique and different from the rest of the world. Mostly, if it is a traditional function, such as a wedding, pooja or a festival, we prefer wearing Indian attires, like suits and saris for females and kurta pyjama or three-piece suit for men. Such traditional clothes can be purchased from anywhere. While there are massive showrooms in huge cities, in small towns and villages, one can find smaller shops or people selling clothes on the roadside. If needed, one can also shop branded traditional clothes from malls. I prefer shopping in small shops as they have an extensive range of options and are not too expensive either. One of the reasons behind wearing such clothes is that it’s our Indian tradition and everybody, across the country, wears it. Moreover, I like such clothes more than western dresses. Almost everybody has a positive perspective toward Indian dresses. However, the ones who are always on the verge of experimenting, try and bring a fusion with these clothes. Hence, don\'t be shocked if you see people wearing Indo-western clothing as that\'s in trend as well.</string>
    <string name="part2ClothesA03">Let me talk about a friend who dresses very well. Her name is Tina. We are of the same age and she is currently a professor in a prestigious university in my country. Although she is not in the fashion industry, she dresses fashionably. She is tall, not very slim and is very attractive. She has been my friend since high school. I get to see her from time to time as she also lives in my neighborhood. We also spend time together with friends especially on weekends. Actually, she doesn\'t have a specific dressing preference or style. I think she bases her attire on the weather as well as on occasions and events, I usually see her wearing light colored dresses and high-heeled shoes when she goes to work. She also wears formal clothes. She is fond of accessories which looks fashionable. Her footwear always matches her dress. I think she has a huge collection of clothes, shoes and bags as I rarely see her wearing the same set after some time. I see her wear casual clothes too but they don\'t look plain or boring on her. I think she can carry herself very well in any kind of dress. She looks comfortable no matter what her attire is. She always looks clean and tidy. I like her style because she does\'t dress extravagant or offensive. She always looks professional and presentable.</string>
    <string name="part2ClothesA04">Although, I wear many different types of clothing, I feel most comfortable in an old pair of jeans so I\'m going tell about them. I\'ll start by saying that they\'re nothing special, just a regular pair of blue denim jeans. I picked them up at a levis store in an airport a couple of years back. I was traveling back to Ireland to visit my family and had a long layover so I decided to do some shopping to pass the time. I don\'t remember exactly which airport it was. Anyway, I wandered into the store, intending only on browsing, but I came across a pair of jeans in my size, which is unusual, so I tried them on. They fitted like a glove so I bought em! Since then, I\'ve worn them to death! I mean, I probably wear them almost every day. I used to pair them with a shirt and blazer when going to parties or smart-casual but nowadays I mostly wear them around my house as they are well-worn. My girlfriend keeps saying that I should throw them out but I can\'t bring myself to do it. I\'m a big fan of these jeans for two reasons. Firstly, as mentioned, they fit perfectly. They\'re not too skinny and not too baggy. I seem to have an unusual body shape which makes buying pants challenging and time - consuming. I was very fortunate to find them. Second of all, they are so durable. I\'ve had them for years and they are still holding up. The colour has faded quite a bit but other than that, they\'re like new! When I wear them, I don\'t have to worry about the zipper breaking or anything like that. I\'d love to get another pair. I\'ll have to keep my eye out when I go shopping.</string>
    <string name="part2ClothesA05">The shop I like going to is one that I don\'t visit very often as it is extremely expensive but whenever I have gone, I have enjoyed the experience very much. The shop is in the center of the city in a beautiful neoclassical building with a spiral staircase. There are large velvet sofas where you can rest while you are served. When you walk through the double doors, a shop assistant greets you and offers coffee and tea. They are very friendly and really try to get to know the customer so it\'s much better than online shopping. Usually, I would find this level of attention from a shop person irritating, but here they do it in such a way that you feel they are really trying to accommodate you. The shop sells luxury goods from high - end designers. Many people feel their items are overpriced but I guess there is a market for these goods. As I said, I don\'t go there often – it is out of my price range – but I did go when my brother was getting married to look for shoes. The selection and quality of their goods are incomparable – from over-the-top avant-garde designer items to classics that can become family heirlooms. So it is the combination of factors – the store ambience, the unparalleled customer service and of course, the top-notch products – that make this a store I enjoy shopping at. I hope that one day I will be able to afford to shop there on a regular basis rather than mainly window shopping.</string>

    //part 2 Colors answers
    <string name="part2ColorsA01">I want to share my impressions of a garden that I visited last summer, which was full of colour: Claude Monet\'s house and garden in Giverny, France. As a big fan of Monet\'s paintings, especially the famous “Water Lilies,” I had always dreamt of seeing it in real life. So, when some friends suggested a visit last year, I jumped at the chance. After a journey of about an hour by train from our hotel, we arrived at Giverny. The garden was precise as he had painted it – it was a riot of colour, from the peaceful white of the water lilies to the striking reds and oranges which filled some of the flowerbeds. The two parts of the garden complemented each other perfectly. We first admired the array of bright flowers and fruit trees in the Clos Normand, but my favourite part was the water garden, and we enjoyed a stroll, taking in all the colours, smells, and bird songs. Monet had avidly collected prints of Japanese gardens. These inspired the Japanese bridges covered with wisterias, the water lilies in the pond, and the bamboo and weeping willows which he planted. It was like a wonderland of colours and a dream come true after so many years.</string>
    <string name="part2ColorsA02">The world is filled with colours. Everything we see is colourful and usually, people are attracted to bright coloured things. I also have a preference regarding colour and that is white. I think white is the best colour in the world amid thousand of colours. There are several reasons to prefer the colour. The first and most important reason is that white colour makes my mind fresh. Whenever I see a white colour around me, I feel a positive vibe. Besides, I try to use the colour in my everyday life. Most of my dresses are made of white colour. The room I live in is white. My office walls are coloured in white. There are white everywhere where I belong. But there are some special cases where I cannot apply my own idea of making white. To me, white appears solely different from the other colours. The other colours have several shades but white has no such shades. White refers to white. There is no dark shade in this light colour. Sometimes it appears that white has no hue at all for its lightness. This is different from the other colours in this sense that it can contain any other colour on it and could change the entire tone. As a result, the combination gets a different look. Moreover, white is dominating over any other colour and could be easily noticed. White is used in almost all the combination for its lightness and attractive features. I have a strange fascination for white colour since my early childhood. When I am in touch with the colour, I feel a sense of deep calmness inside my mind. White looks gorgeous and I try to make everything whiter as much possible for me. When I pick my dresses, I try to have whiter portion more than the other colours. Sometimes, I try to pick the entire white clothes. White brings a sense of satisfaction to me and helps to concentrate on my activities. But sometimes I try to adjust white colour with some other hues so that it does not look irritating. The feelings are inexpressible in a word. For some specific reasons, I have picked white as my favourite colour. Firstly, it is white which is light and eye soothing than any other colour. A moderate white shade never irritates the eye and one can look at for hours whereas it is impossible for the other colours. This is a light colour and suits every occasion. Moreover, I am in love with white as it goes with me perfectly. When I put on white-coloured dresses, I look stunning. Some may opine that white is colourless or no colour at all, but I am on the opposite view. I believe that white is the key to all other colours. You can make different other colours using white. Attractive shades could be made with this colour. If we consider white in our daily life, there are several other reasons to prefer it. When white is applied to home, space looks larger. Painting in white background is easier and helps make a better painting. The most important thing is that white goes with all the colours and thus I love it very much.</string>
    <string name="part2ColorsA03">I want my life to be colourful. So, I have picked a specific colour for me and it is "Red". The colour is gorgeous and attracts attention from people. This is a very nice question and I will describe the matter in brief here. Red is one of the warmest colours. I love to wear dresses coloured in red. It makes me look stunning and beautiful. When I wear dresses in red colour, I feel a special vibe inside me. It appears that I am filled with energy and can do all the possible things. The other interesting fact about the colour red is that it is notable from a long distance. Red is completely different from the other colours. There are various types of colours are available but red is the best of them. This is not the combination of some other colours rather this is a basic colour that helps to formulate multiple other colours. I had an attraction for red since my childhood. Thereby, I analysed the colour with the other colours. This is an eye-catchy colour and you cannot notice it from any situation or angel. I admit that it has some other meaning in other cases, but regarding dress code, this is really an interesting one. The red-coloured dresses always look wonderful and stylish. But the other colours are not like this one. My feelings about this colour are unusual. If someone else hears about my passion for red, they will consider me crazy. In most of the cases, I try to have a reflection of this colour with me. If I wear dresses, red is always present there in any form. Moreover, I also use red in some other cases. Finally, when I use the colour for any of my purposes, I feel very good. It helps me to get an invisible energy and I can complete the tasks with confidence. When I am in touch with the colour, I also feel a sense of joy inside my mind. And I know that the colour helps to increase my confidence level. Red has become my favourite colour since my childhood. Even today, I am fond of the colour as I was in those days. My bedroom is coloured in red, I try to combine red in each of my dresses and I prefer the red colour in almost all the other issues of my life. I like this particular colour most for its warmness. This is a warm colour. It fades less and lasts longer than the other available colours. Besides, it brings a nice look to me when I am attired in red dresses. Considering all the grounds, red has become my part and parcel.</string>

    //part 2 competition and prize answer
    <string name="part2CompetitionA01">Winning prizes are always an enthusiastic part of the events. It boosts confidence and gives a sense of accomplishment. In my school days, I\'ve won many prizes in the form of awards, trophies, and medals. Now, I am secretly wishing to win a marathon competition, where the winner will receive a cheque of Rs 1 lakh, a certificate of appreciation and a Gold medal. I saw the advertisement about the marathon competition in a newspaper. It is a charity event, sponsored by the State Bank of India. The race is conducted to spread awareness about diseases like cancer and AIDS. The primary purpose of conducting the marathon competition is to raise funds for charity and is scheduled to be held in the first week of April. Though I am not a professional runner, I have motivated myself to be better. I have started to prepare for the competition by waking up early and  working out and then running for at least 3 hours. It\'s just that I will have to work on improving my time. There may be several avid racers aiming for the prize money. But I desperately want to win this marathon competition as it is being conducted for a good cause. Also, I will share the prize money with an orphanage and an old age home. And with the remaining money, I will take care of the expenses of the disabled people</string>
    <string name="part2CompetitionA02">Well, who doesn\'t love winning prizes and competitions? I am one from the lot who likes challenges. Prizes, ultimately, motivate us to do our best and compete at a higher level. I am headstrong into board games. So, I would like to win a chess competition at a national level. Since my school time, I have been participating in various chess competitions. And, I have won at a district level as well. I got to know about this chess competition through an advertisement in the newspaper. So, I found out that the competition is being held in a few months. I will have to join a sports club to learn some useful and new tricks to win the competitions. And then, I will also have to practise day in and day out to master my skills, considering the national-level competition is all about experience and qualification. So, I have to sharpen my skills to a great extent. One of the reasons I want to win this prize is because I would like to represent my country at the international level. Therefore, I am trying my best to win this competition to bring the utmost name and fame to our country</string>
    <string name="part2CompetitionA03">I\'m not a big competition taker, so I\'ve not won that many rewards my entire life. But for any that I\'ve taken part in, I always put all my heart and soul into it and cherish every single reward I\'m given. One of such prizes is an antiquarian copy of the book “Gone with the wind” I won in an online book review competition last year. The reason I participated in the event was because I have a love for old books. As someone who is a bit old-school and nostalgic, I\'ve always wanted to have a collection of rare copies of used books. Yet, antique book collecting seems to be quite a bit of a pricey hobby, so I just now and then seek opportunities to earn a give-away, for example, by taking part in a competition. The book I won is simply something I\'ve always desired for. It was still in a very good condition for its age when I opened the parcel and got the book out. It has a dark navy cloth-bound cover, wrapped in a dust jacket in Victorian inspired style. The board and spine titles are gold foil stamped, and the binding stays intact despite some edge wear and spine chip. According to the competition organiser\'s claim, this copy was printed in a limited number of 100 copies only. That means it\'s worth quite a considerable value, and I just felt in sheer bliss for becoming one of the 100 owners of the edition</string>
    <string name="part2CompetitionA04">I would like to win a Nobel Prize, which was one of my dreams for long time. This was also a momentus that encouraged me to give up my medical profession and pursue medical research. As well known, winning a Nobel Prize is the most prestigious appraisal for a personal achievement in scientific fields. I genuinely believed that I could make a breakthrough in science, and I could use the money won to fund education in one of the deprived regions. However, I realised that the work I was doing was too far away from my dream during my PhD study. Besides, I have realised that the amount of money gained from winning the prize would be less than a banker\'s one off bonus. Therefore, now, a more realistic dream would be to pass the IELTS test and return to clinical work. In this way, I can help many patients with their illnesses. I would have a sense of fulfilment on a daily basis, rather than hoping for a scarce chance in the rest of my life.</string>
    <string name="part2CompetitionA05">I want to talk about a price that I would like to win. It is exactly a scholarship which is being offered by the faculty of mechatronic engineering in my university. All of the students dream to win it, because, it permits to study a postgraduate at one specific university in the USA. If I won this scholarship, I will be the happiest person in the world, not only because may I do a master abroad but I also can have everything like rent, bills, transport, food, totally paid. As I said before, this probably is one of the most dreams desired by poor students however, It is completely necessary to meet academic requirements, such as getting an overall GPA upper than 80%, also demonstrating excellent behaviour and skills in the English language. If I or another student met those requirements, we will have to apply for the scholarship in the Unab\'s website, after that we will must wait for the most important notice of our lives. Honestly be awarded with this price has been my dream in my whole life</string>
    <string name="part2CompetitionA06">Sports competitions are one the great sources of joy and enjoyment. Both the participants and the spectators enjoy the competitions and sometimes the events are telecast live on television channels and even some multinational and corporate companies sponsor for the program in exchange for their advertisements. When I was in college in Massachusetts, I used to play basketball for my college team. Actually, I was fond of the sports due to its nature and mostly the dribbling attracted me most. When I watched the sports on television, I started nurturing the dream to be a basketball player like the players on the television. After my admission at the college, I joined the basketball team and suddenly the team was invited to participate an inter-college basketball championship competition. So, accordingly, our team started preparing for the upcoming competition. At first, I was advised to play at the point guard and then was shifted to the centre for my extraordinary height (I am 6’3”) among the other players of the college team. Basketball is an interesting sport and the players are assigned to hit the basket of the opposition to make scores. So, I was assigned to shoot the basket of the opposition as much time as I could. I also took assistance from the other mates of my college team. But it was not easy for us to make scores. Most of the players of the opposition team were highly skilled too like us. They defended almost every attempt of us in the first half of the game. But we finally scored 15 points while they were only nine. But they tried their best to win the competition and made some fouls in favour of us. For the fouls, we got three free shots at the basket which ensured our victory. Interestingly, I took the free shots and scored three goals within one and a half minute which inspired my teammates greatly. As a result, we were the champion of the competition. The prizes of the competition were the most attractive things in the entire event. Each of the participants was awarded a classic basketball medal made with gold and other material while the champion team was awarded a large trophy and that is kept in a caring condition at our college compound. Moreover, the participants were awarded gift vouchers worth $200. The prize-giving ceremony was held in a festive mood and the participating college authorities delivered their speeches and also vowed to hold such competitions again and again. I have kept my medal at my home, safely, and even in my current days I check the medal and remember the happy moments I had in my college days. Basketball was a charming sport for me from my early days and I started playing the game with my friends in my school. Since the school had no such team to play basketball, papa told me that he will allow joining the basketball team when I will be at college. When I joined the college team, the instructor was happy seeing me and he liked me most for my height and capability to dodge the opponents with the ball. So, when the invitation for participating at inter-college competition arrived, I did not miss the chance</string>
    <string name="part2CompetitionA07">Participating in competitions is really wonderful. The enjoyment doubles if you can win in the competitions. I can remember such an event in my office where I stood first in a table tennis completion. Thank you for asking such an interesting matter to describe. From my university days, I was fond of indoor games and sports. As part of recreation, I used to take part in table tennis. So, I am highly expert in this indoor game. I work at a multinational organisation here in Colombo, Sri Lanka and the company is headquartered in Malaysia. To motivate the employees, the company organises some annual sports events. I took part in the competition but only became successful in the table tennis. Since I was an expert player of the game, nobody could stand before me during the competition. It was a glorious victory for me. The regional president of the company awarded me with prizes. The competition was declared and I enlisted myself for chess, card games and table tennis. The completion was held for two days (on the weekends). I was unable to shine in chess and card because I do not have much idea about them. But I tried my best to survive in the games and finally, I was defeated. When the table tennis round began, I performed very well in the preliminary stages. Gradually, I moved to the next rounds and appeared in the final. The table tennis final competition was an exciting event for everyone. In fact, all the employees turned into two sides. One part of them was supporting me while the other side was supporting my opponent. So, there was a sense of rivalry between the groups. But later, when I won the match, everyone appreciated me for my success. Actually, they were amazed at my table tennis skills. The prizes of the competition were fabulous. Each of the competitions had attractive prizes. I won the first prize for table tennis and a certificate of appreciation. The prize that I received was a LED television set of a reputed brand. The certificate was issued by the company and signed by the governing body president wishing my success ahead. I was highly glad about the prize and certificate. In fact, I have received the prize after a long time. I won prizes in my school, college and university days. But after entering the profession, I did not have many chances to win such a grand prize. Besides, the prizes that I received before were small and medals made of gold and silver. Those are still in my collection. But the LED television was the greatest of them. I am happy with the prize. I have not been in practice of table tennis. When I was a student, I used to play table tennis for at least an hour a day. But with the engagement of my occupation, I hardly can manage time. Though there are options for table tennis in my office, I cannot practice there. In fact, I am unable to arrange times for practice. But when the annual competition was declared, I practised a lot in the office and finally won the victory. I decided to take part in the competition to check my skills. I wanted to know if I am like before or need any modifications for myself. It was a test for me as well. Crossing all the barriers, I became the winner. I am grateful to my company for such an interesting competition.</string>

    // part 2 education answers
    <string name="part2EducationA01">The subject I\'d like to describe is World History. It was a subject taught in high school. About one hour is allotted everyday to learn about significant historical events. For some of my classmates, it was a boring subject but I enjoyed it a lot. I remember that our teacher distributed a syllabus on our first meeting which served as a guide on the topics that will be discussed each week. We were assigned to read several books and other reading materials. We talked about famous people, from warriors to philosophers to artists. We discussed the wars that happened in the past. We also talked about religion, traditions and customs of the people during the ancient time. As a subject, it required us to memorize a lot which was a disadvantage for me and my classmates at that time because it consumed much of our time. Nevertheless, history really intrigues me. I am always curious about how humans lived in the past. I have always been interested to look into how history turned us into the present generation. It fascinates me</string>
    <string name="part2EducationA02">I\'m going to suggest that art could be taken out of the school curriculum. In my experience, art lessons at school tend to include drawing, painting, and the making of collages using paper, fabric and other household materials. There are a few reasons why I think that school art lessons are unnecessary. Firstly, I don\'t believe that drawing and painting are essential skills that children will need when they leave school. Children might find these activities enjoyable, but it\'s unlikely that they will need them in the working world. Secondly, children can draw, paint and make collages in their own time at home; parents can encourage this, and they can even join in. Finally, remembering my own art lessons at school, I don\'t think we learnt any real art skills; the teachers left us to draw or create things, but they didn\'t provide much technical instruction.</string>
    <string name="part2EducationA03">Almost every other subject held my attention but History back in the days. Somehow, this particular subject never interested me and bored me to death. However, today, I stand here with a completely different perspective on this subject. In my 10th standard, History came to me as a full-proof, individual subject. Until then, I studied a mix of everything in the Social Studies book. Also, despite its monotony, I retained this subject in my 11th and 12th standards. Thus, I had to bear with it for three consecutive years. One of the reasons I never found my preference in History was that I lacked the consciousness to comprehend what happened in the past. I was never fond of memorizing historical events, whether a war or a revolution. Although the school had issues with thorough, profound books in History that carried all of the information in an easy-to-read format, I never paid heed to these books. I avoided every situation to come in contact with it. However, when I think of all those mesmerizing events that have occurred in the past, it boosts my knowledge. I feel this undying thirst for learning more about everything that the warriors had to deal with to give us the present world. Today, more than feeling the compulsion to memorize the dates, I find it intriguing to understand the mindset of those who initiated revolutionary events and how. That is why I have developed my interest in History.</string>
    <string name="part2EducationA04">It would probably be English. I used to dislike and even fear this subject so much that I felt a lot of pressure in English lessons. There are many things about this language that frustrate a person like me. For example, English has a very different system of sounds, grammar, and vocabulary, making it very hard for us to get correct pronunciation, remember words, and form sentences. I used to struggle a lot too but with some persistence, I managed to get past the most difficult period. After that everything gradually became easier. Especially when you start to understand English movies or articles, you have this huge sense of achievement and that moves you forward even faster. So my advice for anyone who struggles to learn a new skill is, to invest a lot of effort at the beginning and push through it. The moment you get the hang of something, you’ll be motivated and just keep going from there.</string>

    // part 2 food answers
    <string name="part2FoodA01">There are a lot of foods I like. It is quite difficult to think of one. So, let me talk about a popular menu in my country which is one of my favorite foods also. It is steamed/plain rice and chicken adobo. “Adobo” is the local name. Adobo can be beef, pork, chicken, fish or even vegetables but I like the chicken adobo particularly. I will talk about how I cook my very own chicken adobo. A small amount of oil is placed in a heated pan. Then, sauté (fried quickly in a little hot fat) garlic until it turns golden brown. Add in onions. Add the chicken and sauté until it turns a little brown. Pour in about 2 cups of water and let it boil. After about 30 minutes, add about 2 spoonful of sugar, whole peppercorns and let it simmer. Then add about one fourth cup of so sauce and let it boil for about 5 minutes. Then it is done and ready to be served. You may also add some vegetables like potatoes or fruits like banana or pineapple. I like it because it is easy to prepare and it is very delicious. I am not quite sure about its nutritional benefits but I am sure that we can get some nutrients in it too, especially if vegetables are added. This recipe is common in my country and I eat it about three to four times a week. I like it because it does not require much effort to prepare and it is also not expensive.</string>
    <string name="part2FoodA02">I enjoy fine dining and exotic food. Both are available at my favourite restaurant in the centre of town. On special occasions I take my partner wining and dining. We love the ambience of the candle-lit dinners, and the extensive menu of mouth-watering meals. The menu includes starters, mains and deserts. Usually by the time we get there I am dying of hunger so we order a starter to calm the hunger pangs. We usually also share a bottle of bubbly. It is after all a celebration. Having finished our starter we take our time, savouring the food. This is not the type of restaurant where you would ask for a doggy bag, so we waste nothing. We end the evening with a delicious dessert. I do have a sweet tooth, and all the food cooked there is incredible. After finishing the flan and settling the bill, we head off home, satisfied that we have enjoyed a scrumptious meal.</string>
    <string name="part2FoodA03">I would like to talk about a nice little restaurant in a walking distance of my apartment called "La Pasta". It is situated on the ancient street in the old city centre. This restaurant serves various meals of Italian cuisine that I enjoy. For example, they serve extremely delicious pasta, pizza and tomato soup. I particularly love their pasta. It is very versatile food, and can be made in many ways. I general, I love Italian food because it is all about fresh, flavorful ingredients. That\'s why I eat in that restaurant every now and then with my family and friends… Although it\'s not cheap, its quality justifies the bill</string>
    <string name="part2FoodA04">My mother and sisters-in-law just love experimenting with different cooking ideas. So, it is quite natural that I get to try a lot of different kinds of foods at home, even though, I should say that I don\'t necessarily like all of them. But, today, I would like to talk about a food item, my mother and sisters-in-law cook, which I really like. The name of this food item is “Rogan Josh” which is an aromatic mutton dish of Persian origin. Rogan means “oil” in Persian while “Josh” means hot, boiling, or passionate". So, together, Rogan Josh thus means cooked in hot oil at an intense heat. Now, I am not sure from where the ladies in my family got the recipe for this particular dish, but I am assuming that they might have got it from the many cooking shows that are aired on TV on a daily basis. But, regardless of where from or how they got it, the truth is, this is one of the most delicious and mouth-watering food items I have ever eaten. Now, in order to cook this delicious dish, one first needs to cook seasoned lamb in hot oil over high heat until the lamb is browned. After that, cook the onions separately for about 4 minutes until they become brown also. Then, add the ginger, garlic, curry, turmeric, cayenne and bay leaves with onions and cook for 2 minutes. Add the tomato, yogurt and water; bring to a boil. Finally, mix the lamb with all the spices and simmer them over low heat until the lamb is very tender. Now, your Rogan Josh should be ready to serve with rice or “naan” bread. Anyway, I like to eat this food at home, mainly because the ladies at home cook it to perfection, unlike some of the restaurants where I have tried it. Besides, very few dishes manage to bring my family members together at one table in joys and happiness like this particular food.</string>
    <string name="part2FoodA05">I like to eat fried rice with vegetable and fish curry at home. In fact, this is a common dinner item in our country and I often eat these items at home. Fried rice is prepared by boiling the rice and then fried with eggs and vegetables. Vegetables are mixed and prepared by using other spices and water. Finally, fish curry is cooked using the fish, spices, water, oil and salt. When these items are cooked individually, they are served together for either the lunch or dinner. At our home, my mum mostly does the cooking stuff. She most of the time prepares this food item but sometimes my younger sister helps her cooking this item. The fried rice with egg, vegetable and fish are my most favourite menu. I eat this menu at least 4–5 times in a week and yet I never get bored with this menu. If I eat rich foods like Chinese menu or Thai menu 2/3 times in a week in a restaurant, I feel like not to have it again. But the menu I am talking about is quite delicious, tasty and nutritious. One will never feel uninterested eating it. This is a common dish in our country and because of the geographical location we grow plenty of paddies, vegetables, and have lots of fishes in our rivers and ponds. My mother has a special skill of cooking and the fried rice with vegetable, and fish curry she cooks is simply second to none. These are the main reasons for me to like this menu.</string>
    <string name="part2FoodA06">I love to take paratha and mutton bhuna at home and this is a delicious menu. This is a great cue card topic to talk about and I feel lucky with this. The preparation process of this food is simple. You will need some flours and prepare them accordingly to make the parathas. But cooking the mutton is a bit complex and takes more time than preparing the usual foods. You will need to clean the mutton properly before cooking and then apply some mixed types of spices with the meat. Preserving the prepared meat for half an hour will help the spices to get into the deep of the meat. Finally, put the mutton in the cooking pot with the expected amount of water. It needs almost half an hour to complete the cooking process. Usually, my mother is in charge of cooking at our home. But sometimes, I help her out in the preparation process. Besides, I also help mom when she falls sick and cannot continue the cooking for the family. In fact, cooking for a large family is really difficult and needs lots of preparations. So, often it becomes hard for mom to complete all the tasks. Further, the maid, who has been appointed for help in cooking, also is irregular. So, when it is about cooking the mutton and making the paratha, I extend my helping hand to my mother. Paratha and mutton have an especial appeal to me. The taste is different from the other types of food. And they do not make me feel bored. The paratha that I take is fried with a special type of oil which raises the taste while the mutton becomes tastier with the addition of potatoes. So, I like this food item very much.</string>

    //part 2 music answers
    <string name="part2MusicA01">For me, music and songs are way beyond mere means of entertainment. Sure, there are millions of songs and tunes out there. However, my playlist is extremely different from that of those I know. And, almost everybody goes gaga over the songs I like listening to. So, one of the songs that I can listen to thousands of times is Runaway by Aurora. It was released in 2015 and is a part of the “Running with the Wolves” album. The song belongs to a mixed up genre, including Folktronica, Electronic music, Synth-pop, and Alternative/Indie. First, I heard it on Instagram. Somebody had created a reel with a stanza of this song. And then, it trended for almost a month. There were millions of people making reels on this song. First, I simply ignored it. However, since it was repetitive on my feed, I paid attention to the lyrics, which were enthralling. I instantly Googled the song and added it to my playlist. There are a plethora of reasons behind my preference. The song touches the right chords of the heart. It has soothing music that doesn\'t pump you up but keeps you connected. Also, I believe the lyrics are relatable for every adult, trying hard to build a life and dealing with stress. Whenever I feel low, I plug in my earphones and play this song on a loop. If you have good taste in music and like calming songs, this one is surely going to keep you hooked for long.</string>
    <string name="part2MusicA02">I have always been a massive fan of music. I love listening to music because good music helps me recharge my battery as well as uplift my spirit after a long day overloaded with work and study. I listen to many different kinds of music, from Rock to Jazz, depending on where I am, who I\'m with, and how I feel at the time. Today I\'m going to tell you about one of my favourite songs, titled "Hello". The genre is pop, as characterized by its upbeat music and simple, down-to-earth lyrics. It\'s actually a single that just went platinum this week. The song is viral at the moment, I mean, it\'s the talk of the town. It\'s been topping the charts for weeks and has got millions of streams on music sites. The person who performs the song is Adele, an internationally acclaimed artist, hailing from the UK. She\'s made a killing with her albums, but she\'s maintained a somewhat low-profile lifestyle. I am a huge fan of her. I have an impressive collection of her records that I really treasure. Maybe I would have the fortune to attend one of her concerts. I first listened to the song last week. It was when I was in the middle of finals. I was up to the ears in revision and it was incredibly nerve-racking time, so I needed something to let my hair down. That\'s when I went to YouTube to watch some music videos. The minute I heard Adele\'s voice, I was hooked and totally blown away. I\'ve put the song on repeat ever since. I am keen on the song for a number of reasons. First, it was her voice that struck me, which is incredibly soothing, and has a nice warm quality to it. The lyrics is also dope. It talks about emotions after two people part ways in a relationship and I can definitely relate to that.</string>
    <string name="part2MusicA03">I\'ve recently got into Ariana Grande\'s music, so I\'m going to talk about her. Ariana\'s been around for quite some time now, debuting in 2013, achieving some success with that first album. However, although her songs have always been catchy, her voice sweet and tender, she wasn\'t really a top star until recently. Her latest album is what launches her into superstardom, with the lead single “Thank you, next” topping music charts all around the world. I think the reason the song catches on is that she has put her personal stories into it, being a kiss-off anthem, full of post-breakup nostalgia and hopeful sentiments at the same time. I want to meet her just to see her in person, and maybe talk a bit about how she writes her songs. I know this is a long shot, but she did flirt with the idea of touring in my country once. Hopefully she\'ll come here some time in the future.</string>
    <string name="part2MusicA04">If truth is said, I am a huge melophile. I love listening to varying forms of music depending upon the situation and my mood. Although I can listen to every type of song, my all time favourite is Arijit Singh. I have tagged him as my favourite not only because of his melancholic voice but his sober and calm personality as well. The first time I heard him sing was in the movie Murder 2. The song ‘Phir Mohabbat’ was his first-ever song. Generally, Arijit sings romantic and sad songs. One of the reasons why I love his songs is because they fill me up with calmness. I have a lot of friends settled and working in Mumbai. Once, when I was visiting them, I had a chance to be a part of Arijit\'s concert. All throughout the concert, my levels of excitement had no limits. Standing in the crowd, right in front of the stage, I was only ogling at his generosity. His voice was too mesmerizing.</string>
    <string name="part2MusicA05">I really enjoy listening to Maroon 5. I found this music band a few years ago, when I was looking for some pop music on the Internet. And, immediately after listening to the few of their songs, I fell in love with this awesome band. Their music is very catchy and tuneful at the same time. I especially like this band for their driving rhythms. As of today, I have gone to a few of their concerts and have their posters all over my wall. I listen to their songs when I\'m upset or stressed out. They always cheer me up. Also, one of their songs, namely "Payphone", is set as a ringtone on my phone.</string>

    //part 2 money answers
    <string name="part2MoneyA01">Well, I\'m not good at saving money, and I tend to buy things without considering carefully. It\'s hard to save if you don\'t know exactly what you are saving for so what I do is to set savings goals to motivate myself in every financial decision that I make. Going to Japan has always been my biggest dream, but I\'ve postponed it so many times due to lack of money. I tried to keep money myself but I still overspent and was out of money at the end of every month. I asked my mom to keep the money for me as she is better at controlling expenses. She is like my accountant and helps me to balance the expense. She also gives me advice whenever I go shopping to make sure it doesn\'t set me back. We have an agreement that whenever I withdraw a sum of money, I have to save double that amount. This works wonders with me as my savings go up every month. Now I always ask myself whether it\'s necessary to buy things or I can save for a rainy day. After a while, I realize I\'ve set aside more money every day. I buy things within my budget and don\'t waste money for unnecessary things. This method of saving money makes me feel financially secure and good about myself.</string>
    <string name="part2MoneyA02">I would like to buy myself a car. This will be my first vehicle, because I have just got my driver\'s licence. I like travelling with comfort to work and around the city, but the heavy traffic during rush hours makes public transportation really inconvenient for me. However, I am very conscious about the environment and wouldn\'t like to spend money on a conventional automobile that will only contaminate the air we breath. Therefore, the perfect car for me would be an electric one – ideally, a Tesla. Teslas cost substancially more than usual petrol cars. Their price fluctuates around 80,000 – 100,000 USD. What I especially love about it is that it\'s possible to design my own one – some parts of it can be customized. Unfortunately, I can\'t afford this car right now – I have just graduated and entered the job market with not the highest ever salary. Also, I haven\'t taken up a single loan, and I am of a strong belief that credit must finance only investments that generate future returns. And such a consumeristic purchase as a car definitely won\'t earn me any money. In fact, I will only spend even more on planned maintenance. Thankfully, Tesla is not a vehicle that needs petrol, so I will majorly save on gasoline. Thus, I will wait for a couple of years, until my pay improves. I will also have a better range of car models to choose from.</string>
    <string name="part2MoneyA03">Back in school I had a part-time job at a local fast-food joint. I remember getting my first paycheck and going on a shopping spree right after. Among other useless things I had bought one was especially silly. It was a really expensive mobile phone that I purchased at the brand\'s retail outlet. I\'m unsure why exactly I felt dissatisfied with buying it. It was probably the fact that I spent a lion\'s share of my money on it. Or maybe because it had become obsolete a year later, just like most tech pieces at the time did. Anyway, the feeling of novelty wore off after a couple of days and I was left with an overpriced gadget. I think I ended up using the phone for a year when one day it slipped out my palm and I dropped it. The screen cracked and I was quoted such a high price for replacing it that it was simply not worth it.</string>
    <string name="part2MoneyA04">I don\'t normally like to discuss my private matters with anybody unless, of course, I have a very valid reason to do so. But, the other day, I was casually doing exactly that with one of my senior cousins, who made the discussion rather interesting. Of course, I didn\'t exactly want to get drawn into this sort of discussion, but when my cousin asked me about my future plan or how I was spending and managing my money, I thought that there was no harm in discussing the subject. In fact, I decided to have that discussion, mainly because I wasn\'t really doing that well financially even though I was earning a reasonably good amount of money from my job. And, I told that to my cousin, he told me that earning enough money wasn\'t just enough to have a secured financial future unless we were using the money in creating tangible assets. In fact, he gave me an account of how he successfully turned around his failing business about a few years ago by wisely investing his little savings. So, again, according to him, earning enough money wasn\'t just enough as one would also need to find a way to invest it properly with a long term plan by factoring out the future inflation. Anyway, the discussion was not only getting more and more interesting but also getting more and complicated. Finally, the discussion ended with a piece of advice from my cousin that we should have never spent more money than we would earn. Anyway, the discussion was really fascinating for me because it taught me a few effective tricks not only to save money but also to invest them wisely at the right time. Besides, the conversation also taught me how to create and maintain a link with financially successful people who could always teach us a thing or two on how to become a successful entrepreneur even when one doesn\'t have any money at all. Finally, the discussion was also interesting because it taught me how to diversify my skills and money earning abilities.</string>
    <string name="part2MoneyA05">I always wanted to spend my money after my will but the recent discussion about spending money had changed my former concept. I had a fruitful discussion with Mr Robert, a senior professor at my college in Florida. He teaches economics at the graduate level and a man of letters. He believed that people should have money in the head, not in the heart. Money is only a tool. But it will not make the things done until someone uses it correctly. Overall, it was a pleasant discussion with him. This is a smart cue card task for me. I will answer the other questions gladly. Mr Robert was taking a class about spending and saving money. In fact, he owned some ideologies. He never spent money before having that. So, he was talking to the class about money management. After the class, I went to meet him and he explained everything to me. I wanted to justify the way I was spending money for myself. Mr Robert explained the issues one after another and I was simply impressed with the examples. After lots of arguments, I admitted that I made mistakes in money management. He advised me to never to lose money. Actually, I used to spend unnecessarily. And I told him the matters to get some good suggestions. In the end, I got a different insight. I decided to cut my coat according to my clothes. And also pledged to be careful in future about money management. The discussion attracted me for its nature. I was unfamiliar with the ways of savings. And after the detail estimation, it was evident that I was in the wrong direction. Accordingly, I started following his advice and find everything right with me. Interestingly, I did the opposite things that Mr Robert suggested me this time.</string>

    <string name="part2PlansA02">Every human being makes plans for the future.  In the same way, I too have made some plans for my future.  My immediate future plan is to go abroad for my higher studies.  I want to go to Melbourn for my higher studies. That is why I am taking IELTS. I want to do a course in Msc-it. This is the fastest growing industry nowadays. There are a lot of job opportunities in this field. It is a highly lucrative profession. This profession is very popular all over the world. My brother who lives in Melbourne told me about this course. He has searched some colleges for me. He told me the value of this course over there. My dream is to open an IT Company. Through this course, I will learn about the different sections and departments within the IT industry. All my family members are involved in this plan. They are saving money for my study abroad. My ultimate future plan is to open an IT company in my hometown. My family will join me in this venture.</string>
    <string name="part2PlansA03">Because of the current coronavirus situation, few people are able to travel. For me, this is a strange sensation. I usually travel every summer and winter, and so it feels a little strange to stay in the same place for so long. As such, I am planning a trip for when the pandemic ends. This trip involves going down through Southeast Asia to Australia, then exploring that country for a few weeks before visiting New Zealand. I would love to go there and see the wildlife, especially the whales that live in the seas around the country. Hopefully I could manage to spend a few weeks there, too, staying in hostels, visiting friends, and travelling cheaply around the countryside. I think it would be a pretty amazing holiday. I first thought of this plan a few years ago but of course it was just a loose idea that I put off for a long time. Now that the world has changed, I don\'t often think about travel. It\'s just too much of a temptation and the fact that it is impossible makes it a bit of a tease. This plan would basically just involve me backpacking freely for a couple of months, so no one else would be involved, but I do hope to drop in on some friends that live “down under.” I\'ll rely on them for hosting me and showing me around every now and then, but apart from that it will just be me on the road. It requires a lot of planning, courage, and saving, but I\'m used to all of these things.</string>
    <string name="part2PlansA04">Almost everybody lives with a plan pertaining to their study or work. I consistently participate in short courses on the internet to ensure that I never cease acquiring new skills. For instance, I\'ve taken classes for music, French language, sketching, and driving. However, these days, I am planning to take up cooking and baking classes. There are quite a few reasons why I want to enroll in these classes. One of the reasons behind this is that I am planning to migrate to Canada for my higher studies. Residing in a whole new country, with my mother not around, would compel me to cook. For this one reason, I am desperate to learn cooking, especially everything on the Indian menu, so that I\'m not deprived of homely food. This will also help me survive well in the new country, and I would be able to avert the situation of eating out all the time. Since I have a lot of friends and family members settled down in Canada without knowing how to cook, I certainly know the drill. In addition to this, if I know how to cook well, it will be easier for me to find a part-time job in a restaurant or a hotel. Just in a matter of a few days, my vacations are commencing. So, during this time, with the help of my mother, I am thinking to upskill my cooking. My mother is an amazing cook. If I can learn even half of what she knows in cooking, everything will be sorted for me. And then, I am also thinking to get enrolled in some cookery courses being organized in my city. My major preference will be learning Indian cuisine, especially Punjabi and South Indian. Apart from this, if I\'ll have enough time in hand, I might also try my hands on the international menu, especially Chinese.</string>
    <string name="part2PlansA05">You may or may not notice, but we have run across at least one or two articles illustrating how people should live their lives to the fullest every single day. Reading them has struck me hard, that I haven\'t tried doing something risky or adventurous enough in my life, which will somehow leave a regretful feeling to my older self when years come by. And that\'s why I have scratched my original plan to settle down first, to make time for traveling for at least 3 months within the next 2 years. It may sound far-fetched to give up your routine lifestyle and stable income to commit for long-term retreat which holds no guarantee to be beneficial for your next job, however, life is not always about the results but the experience. It will take serious time and effort to carefully prepare for the journey unless you want to let the grass grow under your feet. Fortunately, I am that type of person; hence, I have already sketched a plan. The first thing crossing my mind when thinking about travelling is money, which is also the most crucial tool in any situation. Saving up to the amount that can cover at least all my basic needs is the goal. Besides, it\'s nearly impossible to truly discover local cultures without understanding them and languages can break any boundary. Therefore, based on the list of countries I would love to visit, I will try to learn a little about their languages as well as look into their cultures and customs to be able to communicate more efficiently and avoid taboos that visitors usually make. Emerging yourself in an entirely different nature and people will definitely change how you perceive the world and cultivate your appreciation with everything offered.</string>
    <string name="part2PlansA06">Some time ago, when I was still a high school student, one of my favourite teachers told me that you fail to plan for your future, you are actually planning to fail. Not to mention, of course, I really liked what my teacher had to me at that time. However, even though, the plan, I want to discuss here, doesn\'t involve anything about my work, these valuable words still have some relevance to the noble plan I have. And the plan is to help people. Anyway, the plan, I am talking about, is to open a medical and healthcare clinic in my hometown where patients would be able to receive treatments by paying a very minimal charge. This clinic wouldn\'t only treat all kinds of patients – patients who only live in my city – but also provide all kinds of diagnostic facilities. The clinic would also house at least 5 top-class specialist doctors from different medical fields. By the way, I have had this plan deep in my heart for almost 10 years since the time I started to notice that medical treatment costs in my hometown, along with the rest of my country, were sky-rocketing fast. This high healthcare costs, in my opinion, was also contributed to the fact that more and more people moving into the city, where I live, from rural areas and thus constant pressure on the medical treatment facility that was already stretched before. Anyway, I know very well that implementing this plan of mine is going to be hugely challenging, primarily because I don\'t have that kind of money with me. So, I would need to unite a group of rich but dedicate people to spend in the common cause of helping humanity which certainly is not going to be easy. Of course, my parents have a small piece of land in the town, so finding a proper place in the town for the clinic is not going to be an issue, but getting the permission for building this clinic from the proper government authority is also going to be a huge challenge.</string>
    <string name="part2PlansA07">I have a plan to establish a playground for kids and a club for the adults in my hometown. This is something I missed a lot in the place where I grew up and that\'s why I have the plan and determination to do exactly this. Establishing a kid\'s playground adjacent to a club for grown-up people would not be an easy task. I will need to manage the necessary budget, manpower and financial support to actually do that. I will have to be financially rich and connected with the local authority and political leaders to start the plan I have. Honestly, I have this plan for a very long. When I got admitted in my high school, the realisation started popping up in my mind that these are two things that our community is missing although they are very important. I knew that was something pretty tough to achieve, but yet I started fostering this tough plan in my mind. As I already said, that would be pretty tough as it involves money, space, power, and people\'s involvements. There would be lots of obstacles and I would have to face and resolve in order to fulfil the plan I have. The determination and goodwill along with the prudent decision would be required. If I do not possess great enthusiasm and strength of mind, it would become almost impossible to achieve it.</string>
    <string name="part2PlansA08">Travelling fascinates me more than anything else. So, I want to travel in the future. I want to visit the other countries of the world and gain first-hand knowledge and experience. I would like to thank you for this wonderful cue card topic. To meet my desire, I would need some specific things. The most important point about travelling is time. I need to manage enough time to spend out of my country. In fact, people cannot move out of their own states owing to the time deficiency. So, I have to manage plenty of times to travel around. Secondly, I would need a sufficient amount of money. Without a complete budget and arranging the money, it would be insane to move out to see the world around. So, I have to arrange money as well. Travelling with a companion is better and has some positive impacts. Hence, I also may need a companion for me. Since an early age, I am fond of books and have read various types of books so far. Most of the books were travelling and adventure related. I have an unquenchable thirst to see the world. So, the plan was hidden in my mind since my childhood. Gradually, the plan started spreading its wings in the mind. And now I dream to travel across the world. In reality, it would be hard for me to fulfil the plan. First of all, I am unable to manage enough time to travel. In fact, travelling out of the country requires a great deal of free time and complexities. One needs enough time to handle the things but I do not have the time to invest in solving the issues. Arranging money is another fact. But I will try my best to organize everything even it takes five more years for me.</string>
    <string name="part2PlansA09">There are so many things in life to do and see except, of course, the problem is that we just don\'t have “unlimited” time in our hands. However, as far as I am concerned, I think that I have already figured out what I really want to do in the future. “Traveling”, and only more and more travelling is what I want to do in the future, in the next 20 years or so, before I completely retire from the professional world except, of course, the problem is we can\'t really move even an inch in these days and eras without money. So, the plan, for now, is to work as hard as possible and save up as much money as possible also at the same time. Of course, the good thing is I have already decided what I really want to take as my profession, which is to start a small business, as I have never really felt good about having a “9 am to 5 pm” kind of job for the rest of my life. Besides, owning a business firm allows a person to take a certain level of calculated risk and liberty to earn money in a legal way which may not always be possible if we have a “regular” job. So, anyway, having my own business is what I want to do, not only to earn a living but also learning and reading about different countries, so that I know exactly which places are good for travelling. I want to travel around the world mainly because I have long, from my childhood, been fascinated by different cultures, traditions, religions and lifestyles, and there is no better way, in my humble opinion, to learn about them without travelling extensively. Besides, travelling to different places has always made me feel relaxed and recuperate from the monotonous life of our daily hectic work schedule. Finally, travelling just might also allow me to explore the possibilities of even further business opportunities so that I can actually earn more money while doing the travelling also at the same time.</string>
    <string name="part2PlansA10">Everybody has plans and/or expectations for the future. Though the future is uncertain and often unpredictable, I believe that our future greatly depends on our planning and actions. Well, in the future, I want to run a mega shopping mall business where my involvement would not be mandatory every day to run the daily business, and I would enjoy my time visiting different places in the world. After I finished my graduation from college, I started working for a small company, and I have worked there for a couple of years. Now I am working in a multinational company. I have planned to work till I become 36 and then I will take early retirement. The money I will inherit and the amount I am currently saving per month should allow me to start a business then. I have planned to start a big shopping mall. I will have my close relatives as the employees and authorities of the business and initially, I will work in this shopping mall for 2–3 years to make it run smoothly. When the business would go on with its own path, I will enjoy my vacation and visit different renowned and beautiful cities of the world. I will visit Asia, Europe, Russia and many more places. Hopefully, I will enjoy retirement and trips. Though I am not sure about the future, I have already planned for it. Because I believe proper planning and initiations are half of the task done. I have already taken some steps towards achieving my future plan.</string>

    //part 2 Pollution answers
    <string name="part2PollutionA01">I would like to describe a moment when I was on holiday a few years ago in a really beautiful part of India on holiday with a group of friends. We had been travelling around India for a month and I think I had adjusted to seeing a huge amount of waste on the streets. Not surprisingly, there were very limited facilities for recycling – this is not really part of the culture and it would require a huge investment to put in place the equipment and education programme needed. We were travelling on a train and had been sleeping as it was a very long journey and early the next morning when we pulled into the station, everyone leaned out of the window and purchased bottles of water, cups of tea and hot food from excited street sellers on the platforms. I was happy to join in with the locals and without even thinking drank my water then threw the bottle back out of the window which is something I would never have done back home. It wasn’t until later that I understood the consequences of this action. After winding through the countryside for hours, the train finally reached the coast. I was stunned – rather than a beautiful, clear blue stretch of ocean, all I could see was plastic waste – bottles, bags, food packaging as well as larger items of industrial items were just floating, interspersed with a few seabirds who looked utterly confused and were not really able to swim. I could clearly see the impact of my careless action on the train and the problem of plastics in the ocean became horribly evident. With no other way of disposing of rubbish, the temptation, indeed, the default had become to simply throw bottles and bags on the ground or into the sea, river or lake and so much of this has ended up in the ocean. Since then I have been rigorous about waste and campaigned to make sure my local town has widely available recycling bins for all.</string>
    <string name="part2PollutionA02">Environmental pollution is a serious modern-day problem for any county and its cities all over the world, and the situation is only getting worse for the most part. Anyway, today, I would like to talk about the same pollution problem which my city is also facing increasingly. Not too long ago, my city used to be considered as one of the safest cities in my country as far as environmental pollution is concerned. In fact, many people from around my whole country settled down in my city in the past because of its greenery, clean air and clean water.  But, today, the situation has dramatically changed because its air is not completely safe to inhale because there are just too many vehicles on the roads and streets today that emit carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide. And, we all know how these ingredients pollute our atmosphere and air. As far as the surface water of my city is concerned, it is also contaminated because of too much industrial and toxic waste. Another type of indirect environmental pollution, which is affecting my city, is that its lands and trees are being used (some would say “destroyed”) indiscriminately in order to make rooms for residential and industrial buildings. And, as this happens, it takes away the oxygen supplies of my city. Anyway, as this environmental pollution takes place, people in my city are increasingly suffering from lung diseases and other kinds of respiratory problems, especially, during the cold weather.  Besides, the city also has to spend extra money in order to purify its drinking water, which is putting extra pressure on its budget. This pollution can be controlled by first limiting the number of private vehicles on the roads to reduce carbon emission in the atmosphere. The city should also put in place a more efficient filtering system in order to stop the industrial toxic waste from entering the source of water supply. Finally, the city should adopt a scheme of planting more trees in and around the city in order to cleanse its polluted air.</string>
    <string name="part2PollutionA03">I live in (..say the name of your city..) and this city has got some several issues related to environmental pollution. The major environmental pollutions that this city has are water pollution, air pollution and sound pollution. The main reason for these pollutions is overpopulation and rapid and unplanned industrialisation of this city. The city has more than (…say the current population level of this city…) whereas the number should have been far less than that. It is evitable that a large number of populations in a small city always cause environmental pollution as they use more cars, consume more energy and natural resources and create more wastages and noises. The reason for water pollution is the uncontrolled number of industries, factories and other constructions that have been grown up beside the rivers. These factories and industries produce a large number of chemical and other wastages which directly affects the water. Inappropriate and uncontrolled construction is another reason for water pollution in our city. The effect of water pollution is severe, the water supply would be affected and the supply of safe and clean water would be threatened. A large number of people rely on the water of the rivers and they would be directly affected. Lots of people would get sick due to water pollution and those diseases can become epidemics if not controlled and that results in an immense loss of innocent lives. Air pollution is also very concerning in this city and the chemical smoke, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide emitted from automobiles and industries are the main reason for air pollution. This city has more than millions of automobiles and thousands of industries which are omitting the dangerous gases, and ingredients which are causing the air pollutions.  Air pollution is the direct reason people suffer from various dangerous diseases including lung cancer, asthma, heart disease etc. In fact, the number of people currently suffering from these diseases is alarming and if proper steps are not taken to prevent air pollution immediately, this number would rapidly increase. Sound pollution is produced by the loud horns used by the cars, loud sound used for announcement and cacophony created due to loud sound. Aeroplanes that fly over the resident area created a very loud noise as well. Air pollution is a silent killer that causes lots of serious diseases including hearing and brain cancer. The air pollution directly affects the natural balance by affecting the wild lives. The most important thing to reduce pollution in our city is to create public awareness. We are mostly creating that pollution and endangering ourselves, the Earth and other species. Without our awareness and strict determination to prevent our city from pollution, we can\'t reduce or prevent it. Strict laws should be introduced and be applied against any environmental pollution and all the illegitimate industries and companies should be banned. The decentralisation of industries and offices can be effective as it would reduce the number of people currently living in this city. Job opportunities and other facilities should be improved in rural areas so that people can manage works in their own cities and villages other than coming to this city. Education and morality are two important aspects that help people understand the necessity of keeping the city clean and healthy.</string>
    <string name="part2PollutionA04">It is regrettable that Hanoi, where I\'m living, is negatively affected by pollution and the major environmental problems it is facing are water pollution, air pollution and noise pollution. There are various reasons why this city is badly polluted. Firstly, due to modernization, more and more vehicles such as cars and motorbikes are used. This leads to an increase in exhaust emissions which contaminate the atmosphere, not to mention the rising level of noise pollution. Secondly, factories and industrial zones in the city have discharged a huge amount of untreated waste into rivers, causing death to many fish and other aquatic animals. In fact, pollution makes people here less healthy, and some even suffer from life-threatening diseases such as lung cancer, skin cancer, and so on. Therefore, the government must deal with this problem right away. Cutting down on vehicle use is the best way to reduce air pollution and noise pollution. We can do this by encouraging people to use public transportation. Besides, those who litter should pay a heavy fine. Finally, I think the best solution is to raise awareness and educate people to protect the environment.</string>
    <string name="part2PollutionA05">I would like to talk about global warming. In my opinion, it is a big, if not the biggest, problem that we are facing nowadays. The main reason of global warming is the greenhouse effect. Nowadays people are producing excessive amounts of greenhouse gases, mostly by burning fossil fuels. These gases let sunlight in, which warms the Earth, and then block that heat from leaving. That breaks the delicate natural balance and causes our planet to warm. As global warming changes the climate on the whole planet, it affects all countries in the world and causes many serious problems. For example, global warming causes melting of glaciers, which in turn raises the sea-level. Eventually, coastal areas are flooding and agriculture is damaged unless appropriate measures are taken. As it is a worldwide problem, I think that only joint efforts will help us to overcome this issue.</string>

    <string name="part2ServiceA01">I\'m going to talk about the service we received in a restaurant where a friend of mine celebrated his birthday last Saturday evening. My friend had decided to book a table in a local Italian restaurant for the party. It was a small, family-run place, but this made it feel all the more welcoming and inviting. The atmosphere was great and the service was excellent. As I mentioned, I went to the restaurant because a friend had invited me to celebrate his birthday there. There were about ten of us there - mostly people I\'ve known since university - and it was really nice to catch up with them and chat about what we had all been up to since we last got together. The service was good because the restaurant staff and owners really made us feel at home. From the moment we walked in, the waiters were polite, approachable and attentive; nothing was too much to ask. They brought out a cake with candles and sang "Happy Birthday" to my friend, although we hadn\'t asked them to do this, and the restaurant owners kept checking whether we were happy with everything, which was thoughtful of them. All in all, the delicious food, good company and friendly service made it an unforgettable evening.</string>
    <string name="part2ServiceA02">I\'m going to describe a time when I experienced poor service from staff in a restaurant. This happened a couple of months ago, when some family members, who live abroad, came to stay. We decided to visit a nearby town, and at some point everyone was a little hungry, so we thought we would have a bite to eat. The first restaurant that we came across looked perfect. It had plenty of empty tables - we hadn\'t booked in advance - and we were all happy with the menu. But as soon as we walked through the door, things started to go wrong, and we weren\'t at all impressed with the attitude of the staff. After standing around for a few minutes waiting for someone to greet us, I managed to attract the attention of a waitress who told me that we had come into the restaurant through the wrong door. So, I went over to the main door, only to be told by the manager that there were no tables free for a party of our size - there were eight of us. I could see several free tables with four seats, so I suggested simply moving two of these tables together. But the manager was adamant that this was impossible; our only option was to divide the family and sit at two separate tables. By this time, some of my family members were getting fed up. The restaurant was half empty, yet we were being treated as if they didn\'t need customers. We decided we didn\'t want to sit at separate tables or stay in a place where we felt unwelcome. We left, feeling disappointed by how dismissive the restaurant manager had been, and fortunately we found a much friendlier place to eat just around the corner.</string>

    //part 2 Weather answer
    <string name="part2WeatherA01">It may sound strange, but my favourite weather is when it is cloudy, windy and drizzling as it makes me feel calm and relaxed. I like such weather especially at night because I can hear the little raindrops falling and see the dew on the window, and it helps me to sleep. It is very pleasant. Also, I love foggy weather. It\'s very romantic and gives me a sort of feeling like I\'m in an old black and white movie. However, I don\'t like heavy rains and downpours. And I hate when temperature goes below zero, it\'s too cold for me. Probably, the type of weather I like is common for the United Kingdom. But in my hometown such type of weather is very rare. Usually, we have dry and sunny days with occasional spells of rainy weather.</string>
    <string name="part2WeatherA02">That\'s really difficult as I like things about every season but if I had to choose one, I guess I\'d go for spring. It covers the months of March, April and May in my country and is actually the time of year I was born. I spend the cold winter months looking forward to the first signs of spring as nature comes back to life with the change of the season – things like the snowdrops poking through the soil, colourful daffodils and crocuses, blossom on the trees, shiny new leaves and the birds singing their hearts out as they build their nests. It\'s such a lovely time of year. The weather gradually improves week by week, although we can still get frost right up to the end of April and even snow, but it\'s usually just sleet and turns to slush as soon as it touches the ground. Hail storms are quite common and bright rainbows, which we see as a promise of fine weather to come. Whilst there\'s plenty of warm sunshine in spring, a shower of rain is never far away and the wind tends to be quite chilly so you need to dress up warm to go out. I keep a close eye on the weather forecast before making plans as to what to do. To sum up the weather, you\'d have to say that it\'s changeable – a mixture of sunny spells and cloudbursts is how I\'d describe it. As the temperature rises, I definitely get more active. I start to take longer walks and go out on my bike more often. Weather permitting, we often have a barbecue on my birthday. I also get stuck into some gardening. There\'s always lots of cutting down and clearing up to do, plus the grass begins to grow again and needs cutting. At weekends, I go to the garden centre to buy bedding plants ready for a colourful summer display. One of the best things of all about spring is the lighter evenings, such a relief after the dark winter months. You can now spend evenings outdoors if you want to rather than being stuck in watching TV. So you see, there are lots of reasons why spring is my favourite month. I love the hotter weather of the summer, of course, but there\'s something about the freshness of spring that makes it special.</string>
    <string name="part2WeatherA03">I think my favorite time of the year is spring. The main reason I like it is because it\'s neither freezing cold nor scorching hot. In some places I\'ve lived, such as, it rains most of the spring. But I was mainly thinking of when I lived in Sydney, it was so beautiful. The sky is blue and the weather is nice and warm. The flowers start to bloom and the leaves on the trees turn green. Since Sydney has many parks, my family and I would often go for picnics in the parks where we would play badminton, eat, rest, and look at all the plants and flowers. Our favorite park was Botanical Garden. It had so many different kinds of plants, trees, flowers. Another thing I like to do during springtime is to get up early and climb mountains. There was one mountain near our house called ABC, it wasn\'t so high but there were no steps, only a few rough trails. Another thing I like about spring is that when all the animals are born. That\'s when you can see all of the little baby squirrels, dogs, cats, snakes, and spiders. The air always seems fresher in the spring, the sky is bluer, the grass greener, and the people friendlier — or at least I think so.</string>
    <string name="part2WeatherA04">To tell the truth, as far as I am concerned, “bad weather” could mean only one thing to me, and that is “cold" weather. But, no matter how I dislike this “cold” weather, I do have to experience it every year, just like I did about a few years ago. As I have already mentioned earlier, I don\'t really like cold weather, especially, if it is associated with fog. But, I am pretty sure that Mother Nature doesn\'t really care whether I like it or not, just as it didn\'t on a December morning about a few years ago when I needed to drop my uncle at the airport. As soon as I woke up in that morning and took a peek through the window, I immediately knew that it was going to be a “rough ride” on the roam for us as I could see fog all over. Still, I took my old car and hit the road after wearing all kinds of warm clothes to protect me from the onslaught of a cold winter morning in order to reach the airport as early as possible. But, despite my best efforts and intention, I was not able to reach the airport on time, because the traffic on the road was too slow due to too much fog and low visibility of the road. In fact, my uncle and I gave up the idea of catching the flight, but we still took a chance and arrived at the airport anyway. Luckily, the airport authority had understood the gravity of the situation, due to the bad weather on that day, and decided to delay the flight. Anyway, we were lucky to catch the flight, in the end, thanks to the airport authority, but we had to go through a lot of concern and frustration on the road because of bad weather, caused by extreme fog. Even worse, I even felt very nervous and scared as I almost was going to have an accident because of low visibility on the road. So, it was indeed a bad experience for me.</string>
    <string name="part2WeatherA05">Well, I am from England, and in England, we love to talk about the weather! It changes all the time, and so it\'s actually quite hard to think of one specific example of bad weather that I have experienced there. Even so, I can recall one particularly extraordinary day, when bad weather brought my city of Sheffield to a standstill. I am going to tell you what the weather was like, where I was when it happened and how it affected me I still shiver as I recall it! The bad weather was snow. It does snow in parts of the United Kingdom every year, and where I live in Sheffield we do always get some snow in the winter months, especially on the higher ground. I quite like snow, it can be cold and a bit inconvenient if you get a heavy snowfall, as then public transport stops and everything grinds to a halt. However, it is also really beautiful how a snowfall can turn everything white. It is fun to build snowmen, make snow angel shapes in the newly fallen snow, to go sledging in the hills and even to have a sneaky snowball fight if you are brave enough to find someone to take on. So on the whole, I like snow, I enjoy the novelty of it, and as long as you are dressed appropriately (hat, gloves, scarf, waterproof trousers and thick winter coat) it isn\'t too bad. The day I\'m thinking of, though was rather different. I woke up on a December morning about four years ago and the first thing I noticed was that it was really quiet. It is hard to describe if you have never experienced it, but after a thick snowfall, everything sounds different. The sounds that you normally hear are changed by the muffling effect of the snow, but also there was no sound of traffic. The snow had fallen so deeply, those cars were stuck in driveways and buses in their depots, the only way to get about that day would be on foot. I was lucky because I only lived about two miles from work, so I could still get in. I pulled on my wellington boots, and waterproof clothes and headed off into town. I quickly discovered that this was not like any normal snowfall. The snow had fallen feet deep onto the ice, it was really treacherous even trying to walk in these conditions. Where I live in Sheffield, it is incredibly hilly. Snow ploughs had cleared the major roads, but this had exposed dangerous thick black ice underneath which was impossible to walk across. The combination of ice and steep slopes meant that I was sliding around everywhere and so was everyone else. Although at first, it was quite comical, watching people skidding about and falling over, after a while I started to be quite anxious, it was dangerous, you couldn\'t even stand upright. I got to one road crossing at the top of a hill, and the road was so slippery the only way to get over it was to literally crawl across on my hands and knees. The other side of the road a complete stranger was lying down and reaching out to pull people across safely. It was so bizarre, I have never seen anything like it before or since. The roads were thick ice, but the pavements were piled high with drifts of snow up to three feet deep, I thought I\'d never make it to the office that day let alone home again by nightfall! My normal walk to work would have taken me perhaps 30 minutes, but on this day it took over three times that long as I had to negotiate the tricky roads and paths. When I got there, I found only a couple of other people had made it in as well. Most people had looked out of their windows and decided it was far too dangerous to attempt the journey. I think they were right! My manager had made it in, but he quickly decided it was silly to stay, we all still had to get home safely somehow, and it was still snowing outside. I was working at a university at the time, and for the first time in its history it was declared closed, it was ridiculous to expect staff and students to make the trek in – I should have stayed in bed! We stayed at work long enough to phone people to cancel appointments and confirm we were shut, and then I had the same long trek home in the snow again. I was exhausted by the time I got back! It was quite an experience, it made me appreciate how much we should respect the elements. I felt safe at first because it was an urban environment, and usually, we don\'t get much disruption due to bad weather there, but really the snow and ice made it unnavigable for the next few days. I suppose in countries where they always get a lot of snow and ice they are better prepared for it when it comes. We were certainly taken by surprise. That was my most memorable bad weather adventure. It was fun in a way, but I wouldn\'t welcome that every year, plus it was freezing. It\'s hard to keep smiling when you are so cold! I still love the snow – but I respect it a lot more than I used to.</string>
    <string name="part2WeatherA06">The experience I would like to talk about took place 4 – 5 years back and I was a college student at that time. One day I heard that my uncle is sick and my parents asked me to give him a visit. Since my college was closed at that time, I decided to go to my uncle\'s house. The journey towards my uncle\'s house took me 7–8 hours and I had to take a bus, then a boat and finally, walk for 2 kilometres to reach the house. The place was in a remote urban area and there was no direct bus or train communication there. However, the journey I took to reach there was enjoyable and I had good times at my uncle\'s house. I was glad to see him getting well and spent some quality time with my cousins. After 2–3 days I said goodbye to my uncle, aunt and cousins and took my journey toward my home. They were convincing me to stay a few days more but I could not as my classes were due to start. I left my uncle\'s house at 3:00 pm and the weather was cloudy. The weather was comparatively good even when I got on a big boat to reach the town to pick a bus. But after 30 minutes or so, the sky all of a sudden became intimidating. The lightning and the sound of it gave the impression that heavy rain is approaching. But instead of the rain, a devastating storm hit in and the boatmen failed to control the navigation of the boat. People became so scared that they started praying to God. I was very frightened as well. At a point, I started feeling that the boat might sink and I might never reach home alive. The storm showed no signal to calm down and the powerful wind blowing was trying to take away everything from its way. The wind was blowing from every side and we could not see anything nearby or distant. The boatman yelled and asked us to hold something strongly and get prepared to swim to the nearby land if needed. I knew how to swim but I found 2–3 persons were crying as they did not know how to swim. Their screaming made the situation even worse and I felt a strong urge to stay alive. I am not sure how long this shattering storm lasted but to me, it seemed like the eternity. Later on, I found that the strong lasted for about 40 minutes and the boat has reached a completely different place. By the time the storm has pacified, we were grateful to be alive. We found 1 woman and a kid have become sick and were vomiting in fear and for the sudden impact of the heavy storm. I reached to a highland and sat in a shop for about 15 minutes to realise what just happened. I have some other bad weather experience but no other one was a life threat as this one was. After I reached home, I did not tell my parents about it. I told them the truth after 1 week. I will never forget the experience I had on this way back journey from my uncle\'s house.</string>
    <string name="part2WeatherA07">It was probably July of 2014 and it was a rainy reason when I had to experience bad weather condition and the experience was so bad that I still remember it clearly. Our local area was a comparatively low area, and the rainy reason often caused us trouble. It started with heavy rain and the rain continued without any cease for a week. This causes the roads and fields overflowing by waters. We knew that the rainy season has started. One night we wake up suddenly in the middle of the night and felt that something is wrong. I noticed that the water has reached our house and was approaching to our floor. I was a bit afraid and called my mother. Our entire family members wake up and within an hour the water was all around the room. There was nothing to do and we found that people in our locality have waked up and had been busy to move their furniture to safe places. In the meantime, the water level has reached to well over our floor and most of our furniture was staying in the water. I was not quite grown up then and I felt great anxiety because of the sudden hit of the flood. My parents tried to console me and assured me that we will be safe in a few hours. But my gut feeling told me that things are not going to be okay. I felt helpless and prayed to God so that he takes away the water from our house. This was the first time when I noticed the devastating form of the flood. As it was the first flood experience in my life, I could not imagine what was happening and how would we get away from it. The night was sleepless and the next morning we took the valuable furniture and other belonging to one of our relative\'s house who stayed on the 6th floor of a building. We kept the rest of the furniture in our house in the floodwater. My parents sent me to my grandfather\'s house which was in a different city where flood did not hit and after few days they also came there to get rid of the flood. We stayed at our grandfather\'s house for about 15 days and returned home after the floor water decreased and went away.</string>

    //part 2 Technology answer
    <string name="part2TechnologyA01">Today I would like to tell you about my first time using a smartphone which was about 10 years ago. Well, I guess I am not really a techie or any type of technology fan. That is the reason why having the first smartphone was really an eye-opening experience for me. I got it from my mother as a birthday gift on my 18th birthday and I absolutely loved it. At that time, I had just been accepted to college and I needed an electronic gadget which is convenient as a computer and portable as an iPod. A smartphone from Samsung was not a bad start. You know. it is like having a whole world in my pocket. I can surf the Internet, send an email, make free international calls and even read e-books. The cellphone was so user-friendly that it took me only 1 hour to figure out all the functions and made the most out of it. With the help of this device, I no longer had to carry around my heavy laptop and still could access emails and messages especially it became very handy when I went abroad. Moreover, this phone also replaced a digital camera so it kept many pictures and memories which I can revisit whenever I want. That\'s all I want to share.</string>
    <string name="part2TechnologyA02">I bought a bicycle two months ago from a shop near our house. At first, I thought of buying a large-sized bike. However, I wanted the other members of my family to use it too so I bought I medium-sized one. My new bike is very helpful to me. My weekly routine includes going to work, the supermarket, and park. These are short-distance destinations which I can get to without driving a car. Life is a lot better now that I have a bike. For one thing, I am able to save money. I spend less money now on gas because I don\'t have to use my car for short-distance trips. For another, I will also spend less money for car repair because my car\'s lifespan will increase for infrequent use. Riding a bike is also a form of aerobic exercise which gives your heart and lungs a good workout. This protects people from diseases like high blood pressure, heart problems, obesity, and arthritis. A bicycle is different from other vehicles. First, it does not require fuel and therefore helps save the planet by reducing air pollution. Second, finding a parking area is not a problem if you use a bicycle. Third, riding a bike is a form of exercise while driving other vehicles is just a sedentary activity. I will still be using a bicycle in ten years\' time because the benefits are huge. I am able to save money since I don\'t have to buy fuel. I am also able to maintain my good health. Lastly, I am able to get to my short-distance destinations conveniently.</string>
    <string name="part2TechnologyA03">I don\'t own many gadgets. I have a PC, laptop and a smartphone and I can\'t imagine my life without either of those. However, my laptop is the most important piece of technology for me. I got it as a birthday present from my parents a few years ago and I use it nearly every day now. Although at first using it was like rocket science for me, after a few weeks I was able to do everything I needed. From browsing websites to reinstalling the operating system. What\'s more, without my laptop I wouldn\'t be able to do my homework for the university. Also, I use it for surfing the Internet and finding whatever I want, whether it is a piece of code for my project or a useful tip on how to cook a steak. Generally, my laptop became an essential device for me.</string>
    <string name="part2TechnologyA04">My laptop is the most important digital appliance in my home. I have had a laptop for years, but I have recently upgraded my computer. I am computer literate. I study from home and I need Internet access to do my research. Advances in technology have also made it possible for me to work from home. I surf the web in search of freelance opportunities. In my leisure time, I download books and music from the Internet. I pay for these via Electronic Funds Transfer. I do not condone online piracy, as I value the arts and believe that the authors and songwriters should be rewarded for their work. I use social media networks to keep up with my friends and family across the globe and I also shop online from time to time.</string>
    <string name="part2TechnologyA05">I bought it about ten years ago when my first nephew was born. I purchased it to record the activities and invaluable moments of my first nephew. Since then, I have never really stopped using this modern technology. The name of this modern technology is "video camera". It is a basic “point-and-shoot” video camera, with a size of about 108 millimetres ( or 4.25 inches), and it weighs about 265 grams. Coming in shiny black colour, this camera is made by Canon and is also affordable, comparing to some other basic video cameras in its class. Offering a zoom range of 5 to 15 times, this camera also has a bigger and better lens for its price. It also has a video resolution of 1600 x 1180. Anyway, after buying it, initially, I didn\'t really find much use for it except, of course, recording every little moment of my nephew, but as more and more time passed, I became interested in using it for other purposes and activities. Gradually, I started to carry it outside with me, when travelling to any place, and then also started to make videos of nature around me. The more I was using it, the better I was feeling about my camera and my works. Later on, I felt bold enough to carry my camera even to some parties, like weddings and birthdays, in order to capture the fun and happy moments. After that, I never really looked back, as I carried my little camera pretty much everywhere with me like a trusted friend. My video camera is important to me because it allows me to capture the favourite moments of my life, as well as the life of other important people around me, on my own terms. Besides, it keeps me busy when I don\'t really feel like doing anything constructive or feel bored. Finally, it also allows me to look back to some of my favourite moments of the past when I feel down and depressed.</string>
    <string name="part2TechnologyA06">I have different types of modern technology and electronic gadgets that I often use. Among them, I would like to talk about my laptop for this topic. It is a laptop computer by the renowned brand HP or Hewlett Packard. This laptop comes with a moderately latest configuration, and it supports all major latest software. Windows 10 operating system was pre–installed in it. Though it was a bit expensive for me, I bought it a few months ago as my old laptop was giving up on me. It is my personal laptop, yet I sometimes do official works on it. I use the laptop to connect to the world and browse different websites, communicate with my friends, learn programming languages, watch some videos and sometimes, listen to my favourite music. I also prepare documents, send emails and play computer games on it. In fact, I use this laptop more frequently than any other electronic device that I have except for my smartphone. I own a laptop for more than 10 years but I bought this current laptop that I am talking about 3–4 months ago. Since technology changes very rapidly in modern times, and to install and use the latest software and to get better performance, we need to upgrade our computers and laptops every other year. So I replaced my old laptop with this new one. As I have already mentioned, I use this laptop to use the internet, browse different websites and web applications, play games, create documents, contact my friends, maintain my blogs, check emails, watch movies, listen to music and for many other important purposes. This laptop has become an integral technological device for me that I use almost every day.</string>
    <string name="part2TechnologyA07">I have several technological devices and gadgets, and out of those, I would like to talk about the "Kindle Fire" that I own and enjoy using a lot. This device is produced and sold by Amazon, and I ordered it from their website last year. It is both a tabloid PC and a digital book reader, but I purchased it primarily to read eBooks. It is a popular tech device all around the world for purchasing online products, listening to audiobooks, and reading eBooks. I have noticed that after purchasing this device, my reading time has increased significantly. I use it to read eBooks most of the time, and with Wi–Fi connectivity, it has become easier for me to find my favourite books online. Once fully charged, this device can run for a couple of weeks, and it is an impressive feature. As I bought it three years ago, I\'d say I own it for more than three years by now. With time, this has become an important electronic device that I own. This device is my best companion when I take a journey. The majestic design, delicate outlook, quality hardware and nice user interface make it an ideal device for booklovers all around the globe. To me, this is a significant device as this fulfils my appetite for reading. With the internet accessibility in this device, I now have access to an immense number of books and reading materials. Before purchasing it, I used to read just one book a month on average which has increased to around 3–4 books per month nowadays. I love and enjoy reading, and this is a really good device for reading digital content and books. Reading is immensely essential to learn and progress. And for me, this device is a companion I would always like to have with me. In fact, sometimes, I consider it to be the most educative and utilitarian electronic device I have had so far.</string>
    <string name="part2TechnologyA08">I am not going to be original about the gadget and like most people I use my phone daily. My generation has been relying on this type of technology since childhood. It\'s a thing that does it all, really – it teaches and entertains you, provides information, allows to keep in touch with your nearest and dearest. In addition to that, I often use it to track my jogging routine – it is able to measure my speed as well as the time I spend exercising. I have had this particular phone for more than three years now. Normally I try to get a newer model only after my phone\'s battery is no longer able to keep reasonable amount of charge. Another case when I switch to another one is when it gets heavily damaged, like the screen cracks or there is a firmware malfunction. But if we talk about how long I have been using mobile phones in general then the answer is well more than a decade! I can\'t say for sure. If I were to do without my phone I would feel miserable, isolated, stranded, even helpless! I guess it really makes one think how much reliant we have become to the conveniences of modern technology. After a while though I\’m sure I would get over it and find ways to live without one.</string>

    //part 3 Weather answers
    <string name="part3WeatherA01">Yes, it does. It affects the overall temperature of the world, making the weather warmer. Also, it often causes smog and gloomy weather</string>
    <string name="part3WeatherA02">Yes, I think that people respond to bad weather. In my opinion, during cold and dull days people are more depressed and irritated than usual. While bright sunshine and warmth makes us feel good.</string>
    <string name="part3WeatherA03">In places like A, B, C where it\'s always hot there aren\'t many extreme weather changes to worry about. But in other places such as X, Y, Z, the weather changes so drastically from summer to winter that it affects lifestyles. During the winter the weather may go below zero, and in the summer it may get as hot as 40 Celsius. That means you have to have different kinds of clothes for each season. Also, in the winter you might need heating and in the summer you will most likely have to use a fan or an air conditioner, a friend of mine uses both.</string>
    <string name="part3WeatherA04">One of the things that weather affects is the kind of food you eat, but when it\'s really hot I don\'t usually feel like eating a lot, just some fruit or quick and easy food, like sandwiches, cold noodles, whereas in the winter I usually feel like eating lots of food such as soups, rice, noodles. Also when it\'s hot I just feel like sleeping, but in the winter I\'m naturally colder, so I have to move around to keep warm.</string>
    <string name="part3WeatherA05">Well, if the climate is hot, then the builders will construct the buildings to stay as cool as possible. But if you are in a cold climate then you might find double insulation on the windows, or the houses will be built to retain heat as much as possible. It\'s quite common to see a house with a bunch of open porches and verandas in a hot climate. And probably every room will have a hole for an air conditioning vent. But colder climates will most likely have central heating.</string>
    <string name="part3WeatherA06">As the saying goes, many hands make light work. If the government and individuals work together on the climate problems, there will be many changes and more progress will be made. Of course more responsibility should fall on the shoulders of the government because they have the means to do more than the average citizen. But that shouldn\'t stop ordinary people from doing their parts.</string>
    <string name="part3WeatherA07">That\'s something I\'ve never considered but now I come to think of it, I\'m sure they do. From my experience, people living in cold countries are fairly reserved and quite serious. Those living in hot climates, on the other hand, are more outgoing and full of life. That\'s apart from the most humid regions where it\'s so hot and sticky that you just want to sit around and do nothing all day. Although I\'d have to agree overall, I think there are many other factors than temperature and the weather that affect people\'s personalities.</string>
    <string name="part3WeatherA08">I believe that we\'re facing many serious issues with our climate at the moment and they\'re only going to get worse unless we do something about global warming soon. In my country, the winters are getting milder and wetter and serious flooding is becoming common. It\'s a real problem in many areas. However, that\'s nothing compared to the devastating tropical storms that some parts of the world are experiencing, more violent ever before. Meteorologists predict that they will get even stronger in the future which is a great concern. One of the most serious problems of climate change is the melting of the icecaps as it\'s causing rising sea levels. It\'s possible that many coastal areas could be under water by the end of the century. Now that really is a worry.</string>

    //part 3 Travel and Tourism answer
    <string name="part3TravelA01">Yes, people in India like to travel. India is a colossal country to travel around. There are so many beautiful and adventurous places here. Hence people of India are athirst to travel from one place to another. Indians are always keen on discovering the daring and quixotic moments through travel. Nowadays, Indians mostly travel with friends wherever they get a vacation or a weekend</string>
    <string name="part3TravelA02">With the growing population and economic growth, India has changed especially in regards to travel. People now travel for uploading travel blogs, pictures or everyday travel videos on social media.The mode of transportation has improved a lot, as travel now is cheaper, comfortable and faster. Nowadays content creators go to places, find stuff and share in social media which is phenomenal. Now travel has become so easy that anyone can go for a long vacation.</string>
    <string name="part3TravelA03">People usually travel with family friends or loved ones for a weekend to a neighbouring country or for a family vacation or for long travel. There is something within us that triggers us to pack our bags and visit a new place. Tourists mainly visit India, especially the southern part of India, during April – May and December for experiencing the crystal blue waters and soft white sand beaches. Tourists usually visit India with family and friends. Some people come with their loved ones to spend their most adventurous moments of life.</string>
    <string name="part3TravelA04">I think travel has made people better communicators. It has allowed people to be more patient. Through travelling, people can get to know a lot more about the world around them. Travel increases the desire to meet new people and pushes one to explore all kinds of amazing, admirable things. You become a well-rounded person just by experience. Travelling focuses on a greater sense of empathy and we also gain knowledge about diverse cultures. Interaction with people is another pathway to revitalize our minds. I think travelling really develops a personality. They become less judgemental, more stable, more open-minded, find themselves more optimistic, and don\’t panic often.</string>
    <string name="part3TravelA05">There are many disadvantages of not travelling to a new place. Many educational and health benefits will be missed. We will be unable to learn new cultures and languages. Memories for a lifetime will really pass over. You will not be able to deal with the stress, if you don\’t take a break and travel. Also, you cannot sense and appreciate independence. You cannot boost confidence within yourself. You cannot realize your passion if you are not physically exploring places.</string>
    <string name="part3TravelA06">Most of the people in India own a vehicle. It could either be a two-wheeler or four-wheeler. And the ones who don\’t have a private vehicle travel through public transport like metro, buses, or by local trains. Sometimes they travel by subways too.</string>
    <string name="part3TravelA07">In suburbs there is a lot of free space available. Also in most suburbs, there is an element of peace and people lead a normal life. But in cities, the places have become more and more compact with population increase. One more advantage of suburbs is that the cost of living is low.</string>
    <string name="part3TravelA08">Owning a private vehicle is very common nowadays. It makes our life easy as we can travel at our convenience. People have started travelling from one city to another. Vehicles have made their life comfortable. People have also become a bit lazy as they tend to take vehicles even for shorter distances and also a lot of fuel is burnt in this process.</string>
    <string name="part3TravelA09">People in India mostly prefer taking a walk if it is a very short trip like walking to the nearby grocery shop. Walking is also essential for a person to maintain proper metabolism. Walking is preferred because firstly it is, of course, environmentally friendly and also it boosts up our immune system ,energy, and also keeps our heart healthy and fit</string>
    <string name="part3TravelA10">We can help people by providing them with valuable and good sources of information to plan a visit. E.g., Help schedule the time of travel. We can also improve the infrastructure in an area that can reduce overcrowding in the particular region. We can also encourage corporate companies to build technology parks in the suburbs and villages as well.</string>
    <string name="part3TravelA11">Yes, there is a direct linking between travelling and the environment. When the weather is perfect and soothing, we enjoy travelling. If the heat comes right above our head, we get irritated and will not enjoy our trip.</string>
    <string name="part3TravelA12">The transportation in my hometown is not good. The public transport can\’t be trusted because the buses don\’t arrive on time. Also, the people aren\’t educated and are unaware of the timings of public transport. The most important thing is that women are concerned about their safety in public transport.</string>
    <string name="part3TravelA13">These problems can be solved by making people aware of the timetable of the buses. They can also educate the drivers about being on time. The people can be trained to use metro options too</string>
    <string name="part3TravelA14">Cycling is given a lot of importance in my hometown because it is good exercise. People are educated and know that it helps in increasing cardiovascular fitness, muscle flexibility, decreasing stress level and that it also makes our mind fresh and boosts up our energy level.</string>
    <string name="part3TravelA15">Car is faster and effective than bicycles. A car can hold more stuff into it, but you can\’t carry heavy items in a cycle. Also in a car, safety is guaranteed because of its compact and secured design. A car can house a group of people but a cycle cannot. Also it is way more comfortable than a cycle.</string>

    //part 3 technology questions
    <string name="part3TechnologyQ01">What are the advantages of modern technology?</string>

    <string name="part3TechnologyQ08">What are some great inventions you know about?</string>
    <string name="part3TechnologyQ09">Do you think that the advance of technology has improved standards of education in schools?</string>

    //part 3 technology answers
    <string name="part3TechnologyA01">There is no doubt that technology provides many benefits in terms of communication and entertainment but I believe it\'s greatest advantage is in education. I say this because technological devices combined with the internet give everyone the opportunity to learn. I mean, the web is not limited by location and is actually much cheaper than traditional education. For instance, a few decades ago, if someone lived in a rural or impoverished area, they might not have had access to a library or a good school. Therefore, it was probably quite difficult for them to expand their knowledge. Nowadays, provided one has a wifi connection, almost any subject can be learned online from wherever you are in the world.</string>
    <string name="part3TechnologyA02">Certainly. Despite its advantages, there are definitely some major drawbacks. These days, as a result of developments in technology, people have become dependent on it for entertainment and pleasure. I\'d go as far to say that some are addicted to it, particularly children, which isn\'t healthy. Let me give you an example, when I was a child, I didn\'t have a phone or an ipad or access to the internet. I spent my spare time playing football and building tree houses with my neighbours! Not only did I have a fun and healthy childhood,I also learned how to socialise. Nowadays, children seem to spend all of their leisure time playing computer games which is not only bad for their eyes but also their social skills. Parents should certainly limit the amount of time they allow their kids to spend on these activities.</string>
    <string name="part3TechnologyA03">Mmm give a moment think about that. I suppose it is likely that, not too long from now, we will all live in smart homes as a result of technological developments. I believe this because I\'ve noticed more and more smart products being released. A good example of this is a smart fridge that I watched a video about on youtube recently. The contents of the fridge are monitored and it can even automatically order certain products when they run out! Although there are obvious benefits to smart products in terms of convenience, I would argue that they will make people lazier!</string>
    <string name="part3TechnologyA04">Yes, I believe that technological advancements have made people\’s lives much more comfortable and convenient by saving both time and energy. The light bulb allows people to be more productive as I had mentioned, and the washing machine saves tonnes of time and energy by automating the cleaning of clothes.</string>
    <string name="part3TechnologyA05">Hmm, that\’s an important question, but I haven\’t thought too much about it, please allow me a moment. I believe that there will be great advancements in both AI and flight technology. I presume that soon enough we will witness the advent of AI flown drone transports for humans as this will solve the issues of traffic and dense population congestion in metropolitan areas, such as N.Y. and Tokyo. The other day, I saw a video on testing such technology on YT.</string>
    <string name="part3TechnologyA06">There are a plethora of technological gadgets which people depend on in their everyday lives. For example, washing machine, microwave and mobile phone, which I have talked about earlier. Arguably, people cannot survive easily without these technology. MY friend could not find his mobile yesterday, and he freaked, he thought the world would end!</string>
    <string name="part3TechnologyA07">Well, in my opinion, travelling by train is the safest. So far, it is the means of transportation that I almost never heard of being in an accident. Since it has its own railway, it does not have much chance to come across with other vehicles that could collide with. I think most accidents that happen with trains are due to mechanical or technical issues which could be avoided if the system is being checked and monitored properly.</string>
    <string name="part3TechnologyA08">Two great inventions that I know of are the wheel and telephone or cellphone. These inventions are so important in daily life that their absence can cause loss of human lives. For example, without the phone it would be very hard to report an accident immediately. Without wheeled motor vehicles it would be impossible to quickly rush victims of an accident to a hospital.</string>
    <string name="part3TechnologyA09">Advanced technology such the use of computers and the internet has improved the standards of education in schools. These technologies allow the students and teachers to find answers to their academic questions. For example, they can find the answers to their academic problems from other parts of the world through the internet when no available answers can be found in their locality.</string>

    //part 3 Sleep questions
    <string name="part3SleepQ01">What are some advantages of getting enough sleep?</string>

    <string name="part3SleepQ11">Are you a light sleeper or a heavy sleeper?</string>
    <string name="part3SleepQ12">What keeps you awake at night?</string>

    //part 3 Sleep answers
    <string name="part3SleepA01">Getting enough sleep plays an important role in shaping people\’s health. It helps us recharge our energy after an exhausting day, and avoids being overloaded. For example, an 8-hour sleep is believed to help people work efficiently and boost their productivity. If people don\’t get enough sleep, they can find it difficult to concentrate on their tasks.</string>
    <string name="part3SleepA02">In this age, people in my country can take advantage of cutting-edge devices to be aware of their sleep. Such applications have been invented to analyze their sleep patterns and even give them some recommendations such as listening to the ocean waves or raindrops, which helps them sleep better. If it were not for those applications, they might not know what problems they are facing.</string>
    <string name="part3SleepA03">The key factor that keeps people awake in a meeting is that they should go to bed earlier than usual, else the tiredness because of insufficient sleep will drain their energy the next day. Moreover, caffeine may also be another option to help people avoid nodding off at the meeting. For example, I usually drink a cup of coffee before going to work, which keeps me conscious all day.</string>
    <string name="part3SleepA04">I don\’t remember having any nightmares, but I do remember there are times when I just wake up in the middle of night, having remembered nothing. But, there was friend of mine, who used to get scary nightmares. One of them she told me was in which she was eating frogs and choking on it. It was so scary that we had to plan a vacation to get off that from our minds.</string>
    <string name="part3SleepA05">I think yes, psychologist can surely interpret dreams only if they know the person. Because, then it becomes lot more easier to figure out what the person is fighting and make more sense out of some random pictures. I remember reading a book in which the psychologist used the dreams of his patient to figure out the unconscious mind of the patient. Yes, I remember when I was doing my graduation, dreams made me wonder a lot and whenever I used to have a dream, I would google it down.</string>
    <string name="part3SleepA06">I don\’t remember ever walking in sleep, yet my friend told me about this guy from her college who used to walk in sleep and run across a certain tree until he get exhausted. Later it was found out that he had some psychological issue because of a dark past. With the help of psychologist he was able to fight things back.</string>
    <string name="part3SleepA07">Most of the times, I need a minimum of 6 hours of sleep, but on a tiring day, usually when I am back from a trip, I tend to sleep around 8–10 hours.</string>
    <string name="part3SleepA08">Most of the time I go to bed by 11 in the night and wake up by 5 in the morning.</string>
    <string name="part3SleepA09">Yes, I do sleep as much as is required by my body because I have been told that there is no point of having lot of money if you don\’t have the body to spend it. So, we should take care of it. However, there was a time when I did not got much sleep. It was when I was starting my company, the initial days, there was so much that had to be done. And, even before starting it up, I had to earn more money to be able to save off for it. Those were the years when I did not got much sleep.</string>
    <string name="part3SleepA10">Insomnia, not exactly, but yes there were times when I used to have very small sleeping hours. So, I would just fall asleep and then wake up and then again fall asleep. I soon realized that my body needs care.</string>
    <string name="part3SleepA11">I am definitely a heavy sleeper who has to go for light sleeping. I love to sleep and in my initial years of life I used to sleep a lot, but with later years coming in, I became more responsible and started sleeping only that was required by body</string>
    <string name="part3SleepA12">There are few things that can keep me awake, one is writing, the other is coding. It is when I am doing these two things that I almost forget what the time is. I remember, one day, checking the clock after coding for some time, only to realize that it is now almost 2 in the night and I have been coding since past 5 hours. It is so amazing a feeling that I almost forget that sleep is also very important.</string>

    //part 3 shopping answers
    <string name="part3ShoppingA01">I can\’t say for sure, since it largely depends on personal demand and interest. Women seem to be more obsessed with fashion and shopping than the rest of the population, but there are exceptions. Those who love spending time and money on beautiful pieces of clothing pay great attention to their appearance and take pleasure in the act of shopping, while others consider it a waste of resources. However, people have different reasons to buy clothes which are not necessarily related to whether they enjoy it or not. For example, most men avoid shopping on clothes unless they need a new suit for some formal event or only when there are holes in their clothes!</string>
    <string name="part3ShoppingA02">Women are considered as an embodiment of beauty, which may explain why they love shopping and enjoy flamboyant dressing to a considerable degree. First and foremost, outfits are visual indicators of personalities. Hence, they want to dress accordingly. Secondly, shopping is not only for the sake of fashion but also an effective means of relaxation. In modern society, where lots of people are under constant stress every day, indulging in some severe shopping may help take the weight off their mind, despite temporarily. Last but not least, women don\’t usually shop for themselves alone, but most of their spending is on family and friends. They relish the idea of giving gifts or buying beautiful clothes for their beloved ones. Therefore, shopping sits high on their to-do lists.</string>
    <string name="part3ShoppingA03">Admittedly, the more high-priced a piece of clothing is, the more exquisite it looks. However, it doesn\’t mean low-cost costumes are less appealing or fashionable. Therefore, many women have both high-end and budget-friendly items in their closet for different purposes. Luxury brands such as Gucci, Channel, or Louis Vuitton are more familiar with the upper class and frequently appear in upscale places or events. More affordable apparel brands like ZARA or H and M are not falling behind in terms of fashion trends or stylish designs. Thus, many prefer them and their products are suitable for various occasions, from daily wear to special occasions.</string>
    <string name="part3ShoppingA04">People have their preferences when it comes to fashion, which satisfies both their taste and affordability. I believe it\’s more economically wise not to spend an excessive amount of money on clothing since such amount can be invested more efficiently. The first reason is fashions are short-lived. Once a specific type of clothing goes out of style, it is likely to be left untouched for eternity despite being worn a few times. Imagine the same thing happening with dozens of other pieces in your closet. The amount of money you waste will add up. Furthermore, it will be more beneficial to invest in experiences and knowledge rather than material items. Travelling and exploring the world will bring you more pleasure and wisdom than a fashionable dress ever could.</string>
    <string name="part3ShoppingA05">Plenty of people, including me, enjoy shopping with friends rather than by themselves because of some privileges they can\’t find otherwise. People tend to seek advice or ideas on the products or services when shopping. Hence, a companion can provide you with more objective and fairer remarks on the item you want to buy but are uncertain of, which is extremely helpful for fashion. Besides, it might be impossible for you to refrain from overspending, and that\’s where your co-shopper comes to your rescue. Before they let you go over your budget, they make sure you know the pros and cons. Thus, unless all my friends are occupied, I rarely go shopping alone.</string>
    <string name="part3ShoppingA06">Online shopping, especially for apparel, has become a thriving business in the past few years. To begin with, buying online is incredibly time-saving. Instead of spending hours driving to your favorite malls to get some new clothes from the latest collection, your problem can be solved with only Internet connections and your exceptional taste in fashion. No energy is needed, either. Secondly, you always have the best deals when subscribing to any online stores, which can save you tons of money that you don\’t even notice. Some shops also offer exclusive promotions for loyal customers; therefore, get ready for special treats. Lastly, you can easily switch from site to site to have more choices without moving anything but your fingers.</string>
    <string name="part3ShoppingA07">Everything always has two sides, and shopping online may not always prove to be the best choice. Many online shoppers have experienced unpleasant situations in which either products or service or sometimes both fell short of their expectations. The most common problem is a false advertisement in terms of color, size, or material, which is profoundly disturbing since each person has a unique figure that suits certain pieces of clothing. As a result, you don\’t get for what you pay. Unless you order on trustworthy online stores of well-known brands or the like, customer service can\’t be guaranteed. It may take days or weeks until your concern is addressed or worse, forever. Therefore, be careful and selective before any purchase decision to avoid the irksome experience.</string>
    <string name="part3ShoppingA08">Generally speaking, there isn\’t any strict dress code in most of the events, except some exclusive ones, but people do share some implicitly agreed ideas when it comes to formal attires. As regards men, suits, blazers, or tuxedos are their standard choice. It is understandable since a nicely tailored suit can boost a man\’s confidence and exude power and is an indicator of honor and respect. After all, it\’s better to overdress than underdress. On the other hand, women usually dress up in elegant dresses or gowns, which can accentuate their feminine figures and make them shine. And depending on the formality level of the event, the types of dresses can vary significantly from little black dresses, cocktail dresses to fabulous gowns.</string>
    <string name="part3ShoppingA09">Boys\’ and girls\’ taste in fashion is as different as chalk and cheese since the former looks for the ease of use while the latter is all for style and beauty. Due to their dynamic nature, most boys actively engage in outdoor games or physical activities such as gardening, roller skating, and other sports. Hence, clothes that are sweat-absorbent, loose-fitting, and hard-wearing are often preferred by male youngsters. However, girls appear to develop a sense of style sooner than their counterparts. Therefore, their outfits are more diverse, form-fitting, and fashionable ranging from blouses, shirts, tank tops to mini dresses, skirts, or culottes.</string>
    <string name="part3ShoppingA10">I love collecting jewelry since they are not only accessories but perfect complements to your whole look. There are thousands of types and designs of jewelry for you to choose from, so I bet everyone, regardless of genders, can find at least one item they love, from earrings, bracelets, necklaces to watches. The materials they are made also varied from luxurious ones such as silver, gold, diamond to more affordable and street-style ones like artificial stones, copper or other metals. Thus, they can go with different kinds of styles, and if you do it right, they will make your outfit livelier.</string>
    <string name="part3ShoppingA11">Although I have a jewelry collection at home, I\’ve never attempted to put on more than five pieces since I live with a motto, “simplicity is the best.” I have a habit of picking up eye-catching accessories whenever I come across one but always consider carefully before matching them with my costume. For example, if I dress in an off-shoulder top, a simple choker is good enough to highlight my long neck. When I tie my hair in a messy bun, I prefer a pair of sophisticated earrings such as hoop or feather ones to add more feminine and romantic vibes. But all in all, will never exceed five at the same time.</string>
    <string name="part3ShoppingA12">I suppose each has their reasons. In most cases, if people get attached to a particular piece of jewelry, there might be a story behind it. It could be a family heirloom that has been passed down generations to generations, so it has a special meaning to the owner. Or it may belong to someone they hold dear, such as their spouse, parent, or soulmate, which can explain why they don\’t want to take it off. Another reason is that they keep wearing the same jewel just out of habit. They get accustomed to it after a while and are too lazy to change the new one, so there it stays.</string>

    //part 3 service questions

    <string name="part3ServiceQ06">What can happen to businesses in these industries that do not provide a positive buyer experience?</string>

    //part 3 service answers
    <string name="part3ServiceA01">Well, from what I have seen or experienced so far, all I can say is that the customer service job is a rather challenging profession since it involves continuous talking or engagement with people – people who have all kinds of different views, ideas, tastes, preferences, culture, backgrounds and lifestyles. And that\’s exactly why one has to be really upbeat and resourceful if he/she wants to deal with these different kinds of people smoothly. Otherwise, these types of jobs can be very tiring, if not annoying and frustrating, most of the time, instead of actually being rewarding.</string>
    <string name="part3ServiceA02">I don\’t think that the scenario of customer complaint nowadays is much different than what it actually used to be in the past except, of course, these days, it is easier to complain than what it used to be before. Besides, it is only natural that the more types of products and services we use (meaning more of our money, resources, time and efforts are being used), the greater the possibility of more and more complaints. So, again, speaking logically, I don\’t think that people nowadays are likely to complain more, it is just that the number of products and customers are higher these days and so it seems that more customers are complaining today.</string>
    <string name="part3ServiceA03">From my experiences, sales representatives must be charismatic for their clients so that shoppers feel comfortable throughout the process and in this way give good reviews for the business.</string>
    <string name="part3ServiceA04">I believe that professional salespersons should avoid at all costs arguing with their clients as well as any form of rude behavior. As the golden rule states, “the customer is always right.” And this is important because if the salesman or woman creates an uncomfortable environment they can lose their business reputation.</string>
    <string name="part3ServiceA05">Very expensive products, such as buying and selling a new car require a great deal of care on behalf of the car salesman or woman because it is a big commitment and investment by the client. In addition, services dealing with healthcare demand much care from service staff like doctors and nurses simply because it is dealing with such a private and important part of being human.</string>
    <string name="part3ServiceA06">Companies can lose their reputation and clients very quickly if they do not offer quality customer experiences because clients will spread their disappointment through word-of-mouth to many other potential clients</string>

    //part 3 Pollution answers
    <string name="part3PollutionA01">While quite a lot has been done already to highlight this terrible problem, I think more could be done to make sure the public know the dangers. Apparently around 350 million tonnes of plastic are being produced each year and around 8 million tonnes of plastic enter the ocean every year. If waste management practices don\'t improve, scientists predict this amount could increase tenfold by 2025. What happens is that while paper will eventually disintegrate, plastic does not do this and so when it does eventually break up, it still leaves smaller fragments called microplastics, which have been identified in commercial fish consumed by humans</string>
    <string name="part3PollutionA02">I think many manufactures should work really hard to reduce the use of what is called single-use applications, plastics which are used just once and then disposed of as this makes up approximately half of all plastics. Plastic can quite easily be recycled and used again for shampoo bottles for example. Some large companies have already started only using recycled plastics for their own- brand products and this kind of policy should be rolled out as widely as possible.</string>
    <string name="part3PollutionA03">I would try to encourage teachers and parents to explain the situation to youngsters but also to try and be positive about what can be done. Firstly, we all need to be much more careful about recycling which is not impossible and should start at school as well as in the home. There have been many incredible documentaries informing us all about the global plastic problem and awareness is a very important stage in beginning to stop the problem. I am not sure what is being done at the moment to remove this mass of plastic but we must make sure we do not make this worse, and we protect our planet as well as the wildlife and birds and we should protect the next generation who will also have to try to find solutions.</string>
    <string name="part3PollutionA04">Undeniably, water pollution is a problem in my country. As a matter of fact, I was reading an article which mentioned that more than 38% of the water in my country is contaminated.</string>
    <string name="part3PollutionA05">According to me, there are 2 basic reasons for water pollution in my country. Firstly, although laws pertaining to water pollution have been enacted, they are not being implemented. For instance, factories and industries dump their waste into the water which is polluting the water. What is more, people tend to show indifference towards this problem. There have no initiatives taken even by the people to promote the cause of reducing water pollution</string>
    <string name="part3PollutionA06">Individuals can start some aware campaigns to make people realize the importance of keeping water clean. Moreover, there should be water purifying plants installed in the community which could ensure that clean water is provided to the people.</string>
    <string name="part3PollutionA07">Despite the fact that we know about the repercussions of having contaminated water, there would not much done to provide clean water. Most countries have become accustomed to the idea of contaminated water, and even though the WHO has been urging them to do something to purify the water, they tend to just ignore the request.</string>
    <string name="part3PollutionA08">I think that there are many things that are harming the environment, including greenhouse gases, fossil fuels and pollution. One of the main causes that I have an interest in is pollution caused by plastic. This is a huge issue that is making the environment suffer, on beaches, in the sea and in other places. People not choosing to use reusable shopping bags is having a huge effect on the amount of plastic that is going to waste.</string>
    <string name="part3PollutionA09">In my opinion, they should make more incentives for people to learn about how they can help at an individual level. If they could educate people and make more rules about recycling or using plastic bags, then perhaps we would see a difference. I read in the news recently about how Kenya has passed a law, making it illegal to use plastic bags. In the UK they have a price for a plastic bag. But maybe this type of law, making them illegal should be implemented everywhere. The governments should unite and work together to combat these problems before it is too late.</string>
    <string name="part3PollutionA10">The natural environment is probably the most important resource around us as it pretty much protects and governs our lives by providing us with whatever we need to survive. It provides us with food, water, oxygen, power, energy and many, many other things. It also helps us to live a healthy life by clearing the pollution of our atmosphere. Finally, it is important to protect the natural environment around us in order to maintain the biodiversity (having varieties of plants and animal species) for the overall well-being of our planet. Our very existence in this world is dependent on the natural environment we live in. So we should take every step possible to protect it for our own survival.</string>
    <string name="part3PollutionA11">There are a number of common environmental problems in my country. To start with, a certain part of my country is turning into a “semi-desert”, due to the lack of water, where temperatures are rising. Besides, the number of forests, as well as the number of some rare species of animals in them, is also getting reduced alarmingly, threatening to destroy the biodiversity of my country. Finally, our lands and waters also are becoming increasingly polluted with plastic products and other harmful substances because of the unavailability of proper waste disposal systems.</string>
    <string name="part3PollutionA12">The government can do plenty in my country to deal with these problems. First, they can completely ban the use of plastic products and replace them with some environmental-friendly products. It can also offer some incentives for not using these harmful products. The government can also take the necessary steps to plant more and more trees to make up the loss of forests while improving the waste disposal systems in order to reduce the land and water pollution. However, it is also important to understand that the government alone is not able to deal with these environmental problems successfully unless it takes concrete steps to raise public awareness about the dangers of environmental pollutions.</string>
    <string name="part3PollutionA13">Technology has fundamentally changed the way we live and work, and so, it is about time that we develop and use technological innovations to protect our environment also. For example, “advanced remote sensing technologies” can help us plan, monitor and evaluate the impacts of building “extractive” industries, involving “extraction” of raw materials from the earth, in the ecologically-sensitive areas. In the same manner, “drone” technology can help us monitor the health of our forests and wildlife in some remote and otherwise inaccessible areas. Finally, we can also use AI (artificial intelligence) driven technologies to carry out our environmental conservation efforts by having much more precise information on the extreme climate changes, affecting our earth\’s environment negatively.</string>
    <string name="part3PollutionA14">No, I don\’t really think that the youth these days like to care about the environment primarily because they are just too pre-occupied with either enjoying the comforts and luxuries of their lives or running to “acquire” them as if there is no tomorrow. In fact, German “Federal office for the Environment” conducted a survey in 2016 and found out that just 21 per cent of 14- to-25-year-olds believed that an intact natural environment and the chance to enjoy it were important parts of having a “good life”. Besides, it is also possible that the electronic media, along with the authorities, today are not exactly doing a good job in raising the awareness of taking care of the environment among the youth.</string>
    <string name="part3PollutionA15">Yes, I have no doubt in my mind that environmental problems are too big to deal with at the individual level simply because they don\’t have the required resources, knowledge and the technologies to solve the problems of such big magnitude. Besides, there is no boundary between our rivers, forests, earth\’s atmosphere, as well as the air, we breathe. Therefore, no matter how hard, some individuals, in some parts of a country or the world, are trying to clean up their “environment”, if it is not “coincided” and “coordinated” with the others somewhere else, then the chances are that it is doing no good. And, unfortunately, “coordination” is something which can\’t be “enforced” without the governments\’ active involvement in such cases.</string>

    <string name="part3PolitenessQ09">Are we less polite with members of our families than with people we don\’t know?</string>

    //part 3 Politeness answers
    <string name="part3PolitenessA01">I think, being polite is when someone that exhibits consideration for others and socially acceptable behavior. Being polite means being aware of and respecting the feelings of other people. And there are many traits that make a person polite and respectful. Firstly, the golden rule of good manners is to know how to say “please” and “thank you”. The second rule, I think, is we shouldn\’t ask overly personal questions. Because asking personal questions is not the correct approach to learn more about someone, even if we\’re dying to know more details about them. We should let the other person take the lead rather than forcing them to share things they may regret. And most importantly, another habit that polite people share is they know how to make others feel comfortable. They often put others at ease, as they often have a keen eye to recognize when people are uncomfortable and they know the little things they can do to help fix that.</string>
    <string name="part3PolitenessA02">Well, there are so many examples of disrespectful behaviors. Firstly, it could be their bad manners. And it seems these days that new generations are not being raised to respect the elders. All people should respect those older than them. Besides, cutting in lines is another rude behavior. It happens all the time at the grocery store, at public events, and at amusement parks. No one is amused. In addition, I believe being late is another disrespectful behavior. Sure, life happens, and we are all late for something sometimes, but those who habitually come to work late with the same excuse are rude and affect others. So, I hope that those who are habitually late for meetings, family gatherings, dates, and work should try setting their clock 15 minutes ahead.</string>
    <string name="part3PolitenessA03">Well, I think people living in cities are more likely to be polite than their rural counterparts. The reason for this is that people in cities are often taught good manners and etiquettes from an early age, like show respect to others and the elderly, how to behave well in public, and they understand that being polite can help them have better relationships with people and even open doors for them professionally, so they try to learn and improve their manners. By contrast, people from the countryside are often very conservative, and they still possess many rude behaviors, such as don\’t respect others\’ privacy, force others to listen to their opinions, so I think they seem to be quite rude, and more inconsiderate to others.</string>
    <string name="part3PolitenessA04">According to me, it is just a way of interacting with people. Some people tend to be polite, means they speak softly and are less likely to use harsh words for others. It is for some the way that people treat others ,the way they want themselves to be treated. I agree with it. It is also about saying please, thank you and sorry whenever required.</string>
    <string name="part3PolitenessA05">I think no one actually taught me. I learnt it by seeing people around me. My mother is very polite and she talks to people very nicely, no matter what the other person is saying I don\’t remember her losing her patience. She once told me, that don\’t raise your voice in an argument, but rather improve your point. I have kept these things in mind and have benefited a lot because of my politeness.</string>
    <string name="part3PolitenessA06">I think because of two simple reasons: first most people tend to react the way you talk to them. So, if you want others to be nice to you, you have to start it by yourself. Secondly: because we all are living busy lives and it feels good when people talk nicely to each other.</string>
    <string name="part3PolitenessA07">I believe, people have become more of open minded, less formal and more bold in making statements. So, they tend to just say as it is. But, this does not necessarily mean that they don\’t respect their parents or elders. I think the problem is that people are not able to express what they feel in a better way.</string>
    <string name="part3PolitenessA08">We really value politeness and good manners in the UK, and there are many types of polite behaviour. One of the first things we learn as children is to say "please" and "thank you". As adults, I think we are careful not to be too direct in the language we use. For example, we would never say "Bring me the bill" in a restaurant because this kind of direct instruction would sound rude. It would be much more polite to say "Could we have the bill, please?"</string>
    <string name="part3PolitenessA09">I suppose it\'s normal to be a bit more relaxed about politeness with family members. Most people tend to speak in a more informal way at home; in the UK, we still say "please" and "thanks", but it\'s fine to use colloquial language and things like nicknames that you would never use with someone you didn\'t know.</string>

    <string name="part3PlansQ07">In general, do you think planning is important?</string>
    <string name="part3PlansQ08">Why do people make plans?</string>

    //part 3 plans answers
    <string name="part3PlansA01">I think by the time one becomes old, he/she has learnt the importance of planning and doing things on time. So they like to go as per the plan because deviations from plans often create problems which old people do not like</string>
    <string name="part3PlansA02">Young people nowadays are working on multiple things, they like to do multitasking, in order to achieve this, they make frequent changes in their plans. But at the same time young people like to be in control of things they do and if it is often interrupted by changes then they won\’t like them.</string>
    <string name="part3PlansA03">The reasons for changing plans are mostly circumstantial. Changes are hardly planned. If something or other comes up then people have to change their plans.</string>
    <string name="part3PlansA04">If I make any changes in my plan then I will immediately inform it to my friends or anyone else who is involved in the plan. I will explain to them the reasons behind the change. Informing immediately is necessary because then other people can understand and plan their time accordingly.</string>
    <string name="part3PlansA05">I think simple plans which involve less people are always practical like planning for a trip or outing etc. But plans which involve a lot of people and are hard to achieve tend to be less practical as they need a lot of time to execute and there is dependency on too many people.</string>
    <string name="part3PlansA06">I have inclination for becoming organized and prepared for upcoming challenges. Drawing up a plan in advance can equip people with some knowledge when something unexpected comes up, or when everything just doesn\’t go according to plan. Without a plan, people can feel at a loss and have nothing to fall back on when they are in the face of adversity. However, it should be pointed out that we shouldn\’t get into too much detail, instead, just getting the picture as to what\’s gonna happen and how plan can be  developed is enough for us to tackle it. I mean that plan there are a lot of external circumstances which preclude our detailed plan from coming true; as a result, there is no need to be too precise.</string>
    <string name="part3PlansA07">To be honest, I am a great planner and can hardly stick to my original plan. Yet, that\’s what planning is all about. They say “plan to fail and fail to plan” for a reason. Even though I usually end up ruining my schedule, I make a habit of noting my thoughts and what I have to do the next day, next week and next month since I think it\’s one of the best way to organize my mind and my life as well. Without a plan, even a generic one, you\’re just going around without making any progress towards your goals and advance in your career. Therefore, making sure to keep track of my schedule and personal goals through planning is my top priority.</string>
    <string name="part3PlansA08">Some believe planning is not for everyone since many wants to live spontaneously without thinking too much but others have different opinions. People are into planning since many benefits it may bring. Planning helps you clarify your goals, strategize your tactics and stay on track. Even if sometimes you mess it all up, you will eventually get back to your ultimate destination. Without a plan, you are simply lost in a maze of inconsequential decisions.</string>

    //part 3 people, family, friends answers
    <string name="part3PeopleA01">For a lot of people, friends are important. Nevertheless, I do not consider friends to be important for me. Friends just go away at the time of need, but family members tend to help each other in the time of need.</string>
    <string name="part3PeopleA02">I think the basic reason for the conflict would be the time given. If a person would give a lot of time to the friends, the family members would feel offended. And if the person would give a lot of time to the family members, friends would feel neglected and the ignored.</string>
    <string name="part3PeopleA03">I think it depends on the kind of advice that you need. Parents and grandparents probably have more life experience than a friend, and so you might get a wiser or more sensible answer from them. On the other hand, friends are less likely to become too worried if you go to them with a problem. For example, I probably wouldn\’t want to burden my parents with a financial problem.</string>
    <string name="part3PeopleA04">Well, firstly, a good adviser should be a good listener, someone who takes the time to understand the situation before offering advice. Secondly, an adviser should try to be objective, and avoid judging the person who is seeking help. Finally, I think the best advisers have the ability to ask the right questions and encourage others to find their own answers.</string>
    <string name="part3PeopleA05">I\’d say that it\’s a mixture of both things. Most of us talk to family, friends, teachers or colleagues before we make career choices. However, I believe that the final decision should rest with the individual; we all need to take ultimate responsibility for the big life choices that we make.</string>
    <string name="part3PeopleA06">I have a small family and there are only five members including my dad, mom, younger sister, younger brother and I am (the eldest son of the family).</string>
    <string name="part3PeopleA07">Well, as I said we have got five family members in our family including me. My father is a Doctor and my hero. My mother is a school teacher and a loving and caring person. We love our parents very much. My younger sister is in grade 7 and she has got all the crazy and creative ideas and she shares most of her secrets with me. My younger brother is studying mathematics at a university and he has got a passion for playing football. He dreams to become a professional football player someday though I have my doubts about it. I have recently completed my Bachelor degree in Computer Science and have a plan to finish my Master degree from a reputed foreign university. We are a happy family and share a strong bonding that makes us care for each other a lot.</string>
    <string name="part3PeopleA08">I usually try to spend most of the time with my family. But I cannot manage time when I am out for my university. But after my return from the university, I do not make any late to share the day-long events with the family members, especially with my mom.</string>
    <string name="part3PeopleA09">Well, my family is the centre of my universe. My parents did everything humanly possible to raise me up and ensure my education and well-being. Their sacrifices and contributions for my life are unparalleled. I will always be grateful to be a member of such a happy and caring family. My family members know me better than any other person and they will always be with me no matter what. They are the people who had always been with me and supported me every way possible. I believe that family comes first and that\’s why my family is the most important aspect of my life.</string>
    <string name="part3PeopleA10">Frequently we watch movies in theatres and also go for some day outs during the holidays. Actually, my dad likes a lot to go out with the family members when he is free from his professional engagements. But my mum prefers going to the cinema and thus we, the kids, are to settle the issues.</string>
    <string name="part3PeopleA11">Yes, I get very well with my family members. They are supportive, positive, intelligent and caring. I would not say that we never had any disagreement but that\’s usually momentary. Love is stronger among us and that conquers any misunderstanding that might arrive among us. In fact, I am happy to be a part of such a wonderful family. They love me as much I love them.</string>
    <string name="part3PeopleA12">I am close to every single family member in my own way. However, in terms of sharing personal secrets and spending time, I am more close to my mother than my father. My younger sister considers me her best friend and thus we have a unique relationship.</string>
    <string name="part3PeopleA13">I believe that being independent does not contradict our reliance on our family. Every single person should be economically and personally independent at a certain age and should be close to his/ her family at the same time. If being independent means living separately and not having a strong relationship with the family, I do not want such independence and freedom. We all possess unique personality and a desire to be independent, but that should not harm our family relationship.</string>
    <string name="part3PeopleA14">Yes, I do get along well with my family members. We have a strong bond among us and that makes us a happy family.</string>
    <string name="part3PeopleA15">Celebrations are remarkable, particularly the celebration of any special occasions like a birthday, the anniversary of my parents or any special achievement by my siblings etc. These events have so many special memories and we consider those occasions as our special moments.</string>
    <string name="part3PeopleA16">Most the people prefer to be with their families and do everything for the members. But exceptions are everywhere. The people living just opposite of our apartment do not have a strong bond among the family members and always engaged in quarrelling with each other which is unwanted and indecent.</string>
    <string name="part3PeopleA17">Most of my friends are my age and I have a few friends who are senior to me. The reason I have friends of my age is that they were mostly my classmates initially and then became my good friends. Most of my friends are from my high school and college and that naturally make them to be my age.</string>
    <string name="part3PeopleA18">When I was in my early teens, I preferred many friends but nowadays I have few friends but they are very close to me. So I would say, I prefer having few close friends than having too many ordinary friends.</string>
    <string name="part3PeopleA19">I usually see my friends during weekends. Weekdays are busy days and after I get back home in the evening, I prefer to stay at home with my family members.</string>
    <string name="part3PeopleA20">I usually prefer to be with my friends. However there are times when I need my personal time and in this case, I prefer solitude rather than companies.</string>
    <string name="part3PeopleA21">Well, we played badminton together and had our dinner at a nearby restaurant. That\’s the last thing I can recall doing with my friends and that would about a week ago.</string>
    <string name="part3PeopleA22">I share many common interests with my friends and that makes us having pleasant activities and conversations together. They are quite helpful and supportive to me in times of desperate time. I can share almost anything with them and that makes them special to me. Having good friends is like being blessed and that\’s why they are very important to me.</string>
    <string name="part3PeopleA23">That depends. Sometimes I prefer being with my friends and sometimes I prefer staying at home with my family members. I try to maintain a balance in terms of spending time with my friends and with my family. For example, while playing any outdoor sports, I prefer going out with friends. However, I enjoy watching movies and dining out with my family members.</string>
    <string name="part3PeopleA24">As I\’ve already said, I had many friends when I was in my high school. But these days I have comparatively fewer close friends.</string>
    <string name="part3PeopleA25">I enjoy playing outdoor games, watching movies in a theatre, having conversations related to recent political and international issues, sharing my updates and concerns, going long drive with my friends. The best part is the open conversation we can have related to almost any topic.</string>
    <string name="part3PeopleA26">To me, my family is more important. However, this does not make my friends less important to me. Naturally, family comes first for almost everybody and then the friendship. I am no exception.</string>
    <string name="part3PeopleA27">Yes, I believe so. In early ages, we are prone to make many friends and only a few of them remain for a long. At this stage in life, the friendship is not that deep except in some cases. On the contrary, when we get older we prefer to have few friends but most of them remain as loyal and close friends. In young ages, our expectations from friends are to enjoy their companionship and doing all the crazy things with them. However, in older ages, we expect far more from our friends and they become more like family members than being simply friends.</string>
    <string name="part3PeopleA28">Well, that\’s a tough question! Not that I have not thought about it, but I have never drawn a solid conclusion about it! Umm, my expectation from a good friend is that he would be a good companion, good listener, would criticise me whenever needed, would be supportive and positive. He must be honest and would have a sense of humour. Finally, I expect him to be more like a family member than an outsider.</string>
